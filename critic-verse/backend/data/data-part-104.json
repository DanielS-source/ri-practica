Justice died out and only the people with power could survive in this city. Gangs took over for fortune and fame.  You are the boss of a gang and seek to increase your territory in Peanuts City by fighting against enemies in the bay area or uptown, shown on the side view.  Can you really become the ruler of Peanuts City?  Welcome to the world of Gang Street Wars! Gang Street Wars is a tower defense game with Real Time Strategy. Tower defense games are very popular in iPhone applications. Real Time Strategy (RTS) is also popular in console game. We mixed up both two together and made a new type of applications!   Gang Street Wars is a side-scrolling tower defense game. Your mission of this game is building up your gang units, sending them to the enemy gang units for fighting, and conquering the enemy&#39;s base. Once you produce gang units, they automatically march forward to the enemy units. When your gang units face the enemy&#39;s unit on the front line, they stop and start fighting each other until one falls. The one unit who wins the battle can move ahead until he encounters the next enemy unit or reach to enemy&#39;s base. Gang unit consumes all its power or keep fighting until he conquers the enemy&#39;s base.   You can produce the following fighting and defense units:  - Fighting units - ?Macx: Production speed is fast but attack power is low. It can recover your territory.  ?Frankie: Production speed and attack capability is normal. Can attack over long distances. ?Noodles: Very efficient for long distance attack but weak for close-quarter fighting. ?Debora: Attack and defense power is high but when the unit dies, it deals damage to friend and foe alike.  - Defense units - These units are fixed to the ground. They absorb the damage done to the territory until the guard is destroyed.  ?Pistol Defense: Cheap and easy to use. It attacks only enemies in front of it.  ?Machine-gun Defense: Can attack enemies farther away than the Pistol Defense. ?Dynamite Defense: Throws dynamite and ca defeat multiple enemies.  We also focus on sound effects like gunfire, bomb explosion, and Hip Hop taste background music. We hope you enjoy this sound!

The goal is to reach a previously designated destination. What makes this game different from others of the same genre is a complete freedom to choose the route, even if it means driving across the roughest terrain. It is solely the player-s decision what route to take. \\r The player can choose from ten 4WD off-road vehicles. The creators have designed 4 types of races. -Race- is a lap-based competition in which the winner is the person who crosses the finish line first. -Longrun- is a time trial rally. -Pathfinder- gives you a chance to choose any route on the way to your destination. -Trial- is somewhat similar, but in this race the conditions are utterly extreme. After winning races you gain points and money, which in turn allows you to buy better equipped vehicles. Races take place in three locations: in the rainy Alpine meadows and woods, on the hot, rocky desert, and on the ice-covered plains of Alaska. All locations and vehicles are extraordinarily accurate and realistic.\", \"genre\": [\"Auto Racing Sim\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2008-10-01\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-91692-13.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-91692-13.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\", \"Australia\", \"Europe\"], \"companies\": [\"City Interactive (Publisher)\", \"The Easy Company s.r.o.

For each level you are given a number of balls to pop to finish the level, you will also be given a limited number of pops - so  choose carefully, these values are depicted by the 2 bars in the top left hand corner.

On a warm spring day in 59 AD, the cobblestone streets of Rome were filled with the wailing cries of poor bambini. Ever since that fateful day, children the world over have been robbed of the pure joy of RUNNING WITH SCISSORS.   These days, thanks to clumsy little Antonio, every time a kid picks up scissors and gets a gleam in their eye, some mom shouts, &#34;Operor non vado velox per forfex!&#34; &#34;NO RUNNING WITH SCISSORS!&#34;    In those days, the invention of scissors had quickly given birth to the pure, exhilarating sport of RUNNING WITH SCISSORS. For obvious reasons, it was selected as a trial Olympic sport. One day the sensation was sweeping the globe, the next it was squashed by the moms. Little Antonio went down in history as the first and last gruesome death caused by running with scissors. For over 100 generations and in over 400 languages the phrase &#34;Don&#39;t run with scissors&#34; has completely dominated the landscape and eliminated the once pure joy of the sport. This travesty has led to an endless chain of maladies, injustices, and even drugs invented to take the place of RUNNING WITH SCISSORS.  Now, for the first time in nearly 2,000 years you can experience the joy of safe, free-wheeling, RUNNING WITH SCISSORS!   Thanks to the rapid advancement of mobile technology and the creative team at New Potato, this innovative application now makes it completely safe for children (not yet approved for adults!) to RUN WITH SCISSORS! As the world rediscovers this joy and regains its once lost skill, this sport will once again dominate the Olympic scene.  This experiment in entertainment will measure your unbridled enthusiasm, tenacity, and raw energy as you compete for the highest score!
