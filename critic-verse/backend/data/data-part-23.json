Such an image is made by superimposing two separate images, one for each eye and with geometric offset to each other, to produce a stereo 3D effect.* Where to get anaglyph glasses?By searching the keyword &quot;anaglyph 3D glasses&quot; from the Internet, you will find quite a few manufactures and retailers who sell such glasses. Some of them offer free pairs of anaglyph glasses as samples; all you need to do is to send them a self-addressed stamped envelope.* Choose correct glasses typeGlasses type names correspond to lens colors (left - right) of the glasses. Please choose the one that matches your actual glasses' lens colors. Note that this application uses patent-free color encodings, so that expected stereoscopic effects may not be fully achieved by patented anaglyph glasses.* Vision health in wearing anaglyph glassesProlonged viewing of anaglyph images may cause strain, dizziness, or visual color incorrectness for the eyes and therefore is not recommended, particularly for children. It is recommended that you switch back to normal 3D view to have your eyes relaxed after wearing anaglyph glasses for a while.\", \"genre\": [\"Racing\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2011-04-20\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-189396-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-189396-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"OmniG Software Inc.
