But no Dragon Ball Z game would be complete without its fair share of spectacular battles.

Defeat your opponent by blasting damaging Ki attacks from the sky or by diving into him and launching an explosive smash attack. The game features over 40 unique characters, not counting the various character transformations which multiply the playing potential.

Several genres are mixed in this game but despite that fact it isn't stuck between them and appears to be a classical RPG that is based on a specially developed system. The action takes place on prison planet Alcatraz. Its inhabitants are inveterate criminals that were banished there for the life term for their terrible crimes. The main objective of the game is to control a sabotage group that consists of the only one person in the beginning and enlarges through the game. The player has to use all sorts of resources and means to accomplish the mission.\", \"genre\": [\"JRPG\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": \"6.5\", \"user_reviews\": 17, \"release_date\": \"2014-04-16\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-132659-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-379901-52.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": [\"Dmitry Puchkov (Written By: written by)\", \"Vyacheslav Razbegaev (Cast: Boar)\", \"Dmitriy Polonskiy (Cast)\", \"Nikita Semyonov-Prozorovskiy (Cast: Sullen)\", \"Elena Solovieva (Cast)\"], \"countries\": [\"Europe\", \"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"1C Entertainment (Publisher)\", \"1C Entertainment (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Bird Brain\", \"title_search\": \"bird brain\", \"title_keyword\": \"bird brain\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/bird-brain/\", \"summary\": null, \"genre\": [\"Arcade\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": null, \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-644795-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-644795-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": null, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Emerald Valley Publishing Co.
