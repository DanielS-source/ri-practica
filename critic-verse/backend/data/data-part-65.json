First off, the most requested feature, deleting Bouncers, is in the next update which is currently going through our final QA and will be submitted soon (yes, I do listen, I&#39;m just a bit slow at times)   So what is Jounce? It is the result of my boredom. More specifically, it is a Musical Puzzle Game, so let&#39;s call it an MPG (yay, new acronym!)  Balls fall from above, and you place bouncers with a flick of your finger to direct them around obstacles towards the goal somewhere along the bottom.  Technically, there&#39;s no music in Jounce though.  So where does the M in MPG come from? Each time a ball hits a bouncer, it plays a sound, there are about 2 octaves worth of sounds the bouncers select from when you create them, so you end up with this cool generative music thing going on.   If you&#39;ve bothered to read this far, I guess that means you&#39;re probably at least somewhat interested in Jounce, so if you haven&#39;t yet, why not go ahead and buy it now? I&#39;ll wait till you&#39;re done to continue...ready? Ok.   I don&#39;t care for games that have you trying for the fewest moves, because that puts a hard cap on just how good you can be.  With Jounce, I took the opposite tack: each bounce increases a balls value by one point, so to really rack up a high score, besides getting the balls to reach the goal, you have to make them bounce.  A Lot. Like an entire room full of kids on a massive sugar high.   The controls are pretty simple: Just tap and drag to place a bouncer.  Want to remove a bouncer? Now you can! Just tap on one once to select it (turns red) then tap again to remove it.  Tapping or dragging anywhere else will unselect it.   Oh yea, there are just over 32,000 levels...so let&#39;s see  &lt;mumbles to self...carry the one...&gt;  that&#39;s somewhere around 1000 hours of play time if you wanted to play every single level, just one time (you&#39;ll get a shiny Open Feint Achievement if you actually manage to do this!).   I want to improve Jounce even further - I think multiplayer could be quite fun in it, and I&#39;d like to try some other stuff out like a music creator mode, and maybe a more structured arcade mode.  But I admit, I tend to be far more productive when it appears ya&#39;ll are playing jounce, and the easiest indicator I have of that, is the number of downloads it gets.  So please, get everyone you know to purchase Jounce, and help me be productive!\", \"genre\": [\"Puzzle\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-08-19\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-126308-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-126308-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Max Gaming Technologies, LLC (Publisher)\", \"Max Gaming Technologies, LLC (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Rummy\", \"title_search\": \"rummy\", \"title_keyword\": \"rummy\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/rummy/\", \"summary\": \"Rummy &ndash; this card game classic is played all over the world.

You! Yes, the one at the iTunes Store! You think you're a good soccer player? Of course, everybody says that. But to be the world's number one, you must be strong, accurate, train hard and get your shirt swet. Got the skills? All right, all right then. You may show them in Brazooka Soccer.This is a free kick challenge game. In each challenge you will have 3 chances to shoot the ball the nearest to the target as you can. If you meet the level required score, you move forward. What? If you don't? Well... Then it's game over my friend! Remember what I said about getting your shirt swet and everything? Try again, and try harder! Ok, now let me tell you about the rules.A kick is divided into 3 steps:- 1st Step: Before getting into action, you can freely observe the current challenge moving and zooming the camera. This way you can calculate the best kick settings for the next two steps without time limits.- 2nd Step: Here you have to set the kick direction and power. Direction measures how your kick destination will get farther from the center of the goal. Power defines the ball speed, affecting also the distance it will travel. Beware of the time limit.- 3rd Step: In this step you choose where your kick will hit the ball, defining the ball trajectory and distance from the ground. The lower you aim, the higher the ball gets. The more to the left or to the right, the more the ball trajectory will change from straight to curve. Again, beware of the time limit.There are 2 modes for you to try:TRAINING MODETrain before you try the long run. In this mode you can set your free kick and goal target positions, so you can practice the hardest shots.ENDLESS MODEThis is the real thing. Every new level becomes harder. If you are good enough, you will behold the stadium getting crowded while you move through levels. How many points can you get? Can you be the ranking number 1?That's it! What are you waiting for?

Break &#39;em ALL!  We are unsure as to the reasoning behind this apparently natural need to break these Cubes. Perhaps it&#39;s because we can.  Cubik is a quick and easy game to learn and play. Be forewarned that some have referred to the gameplay as &#34;painfully addictive&#34;. (They really said that, I&#39;m not making it up)  These Cubes must be destroyed. It&rsquo;s a dirty job but someone has got to do it! The task is quite literally in your hands.  Do your best to gather Energy Points by memorizing Cube colors and tapping the central Cubes in the same order. Tilt your device to navigate around the Cube cluster in this fully 3D environment to find the Cubes you need. Find Power Upgrades. Find Power Surges.  Use these acquired Powers and your down right awesome skill to quickly destroy the Cubes before too many enter the screen and overload the system!   FEATURES --------------------------  - Adjustable settings allow you to exploit your own natural skills of memorization and recall. - Adjustable Gear Icon can be moved to your preferred side, just in case you like playing with the other hand.  - Progressive design elements allow you to become better with every play.  - Set your &#34;Play Position&#34; to which ever angle you like and at any time. You like to play while standing on your head? No problem. While posing for a catalog stretched out sideways? No problem. In bed? Definitely no problem!  - Enjoy your own music while breaking Cubes with or without the sounds of smashing. We always thought that song should have some shatter in it.  GAMEPLAY --------------------------  Hold your finger on the Gear icon to generate a color Cube sequence. Memorize the Cubes as they are displayed in realtime. Memorize three or thirty, it&#39;s your choice depending on the size of your cranium. Stuff your brain with these Cubes then tap the central Cubes in the same order as memorized to gather Energy Points.  Meanwhile, more Cubes are entering your screen at an increasing rate. Use your acquired Energy Points to shatter those Cubes and maintain a reasonable number of on-screen Cubes. MOre than six of any color will overload the system, at which time you&#39;ll have only a few short seconds to eradicate the issue.   Your success is not entirely reliant on your short-term memory, you may find help from within. During the act of smashing Cubes into oblivion and scattering they&#39;re fragmented shards across a void of vast emptiness, certain advantages may present themselves.  Power Spikes attach themselves to the hull of your Cube Display to increase the amount of Energy taken from each Cube in a repeat sequence. These neat little helpy helpers will also remain attached from game to game, right by your side like a faithful companion. Make too many mistakes and they may jump ship, so be careful.  Power Surges are the most fun to use. They grant an ability of mass Cube destruction. Once found, Surges will sit and wait in their holding mechanism until you decide to facilitate their power. Drag them over and plug them in. A spectacle of fading Cube fragments is only a gentle shaking away.  Have fun.   FUTURE --------------------------  I will be paying close attention to ALL the players of Cubik. I thank you for purchasing the game and I feel an obligation to make it the best experience it can be. Your feedback is of great importance to me, so please feel free to leave comments and/or email me with your thoughts.  Future updates with additional content are already in development. So increase your high scores before this game gets real hot and everyone has it. Then you can say, &#34;Oh what, Cubik? I&#39;ve been playing that for days!

The nefarious cat kind (the Felinarians) forged a plan so evil and twisted to enslave all life that even the thought of it was able to drive the weak minded insane. The peaceful titans (the cows) bore milk to feed Albigana, the wellspring of life. After stealing milk from the cows the Felinarians filtered and destilated it through their twisted machines in a horrid process called &#34;fermentation&#34;. The outcome named &#34;cheese&#34; ought to be the single most powerful drug ever created. Blinded by it&#39;s unholy seductive taste and alluring smell simple life forms fell victim and prey to the increasingly powerful Felinarians. Ages went by and the universe darkened and filled with grief while agony and sorrow marked the fate of countless planets. And then...
