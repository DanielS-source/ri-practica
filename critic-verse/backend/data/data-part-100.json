Each time play will give us a new feeling. We can call it the top grade in the game. The game also provides local integral ranking. We can share the game with our friends. My friends, let&rsquo;s play the game together and expect who can go through more stages and get more scores.  Rules of the game: - Water drops introduction: it can be divided into five kinds: one-level drops, two-level drops, three-level drops, four level drops, splashing drops. - Game starts: to start the game with 10 one-level drops (10 times touch opportunities)  - Game interface has a number of different levels drops, which is in random positions.  - Game pass standard: making all drops disappear on the interface players can enter the next stage. - How: we make full use of 10 one-level drops and make them upgrade by putting them into other drops. If we add a one-level drop to a four-level drop, which can cause to burst four splashing drops and splash to four directions., and each drop met by splashing drop will be upgraded, and so on. - Operating skills: TEN DROPS places emphasis on using the least drops to create the largest chain reaction. We should try to let splashing drops to hit four-level (round) drops and make it disappear. The system will reward us one one-level drop (one touch opportunity) if we can clear up three four-level drops by one click. The system will rewards us two one-level drops (two times touch opportunities)if we clear up six four-level drops, and like this. Passing one stage each time players can be rewarded one one-level drop. Finally, every ten stages increase one-level difficulty of the game. - Game over: When all the touch opportunities were run out of, there&rsquo;s still has drops in interface, which means game is over.  Story Background:    Earth&#39;s water resources are limited, which come from rivers and lakes, from our planet, our home. To us and our future generations, we must treasure every drop of water.   Over the years, we just always ask for, but we wasted a lot of water, we have already made the earth sore all over the eyes.   We can not wait. We must act from present, cherish the resources around us. Let us start to love every drop of water.   This is the idea of the game: using the least resources to do most things.

And Rome, the eternal city, wakes up. The bars and stores open for business, the tourists gather at the museums and the sounds of traffic blankets the streets. For Elisa, this seems like another typical day. First, she attends her university journalism class, grabs a quick chat with friends, and then races off for her work at a small local newspaper, the Eco di Roma. Unfortunately, her time there is split between boring odd jobs and reprimands from her boss. None of this suits the ambitious young intern, who yearns for a real assignment and the chance for \\\"the story\\\" that will make her name as a reporter. But this October day will be anything but typical for Elisa.   Her adventure begins with what she thinks is nothing more than a way to pass time at the newspaper. A mysterious coded message turns up and Elisa decides to try her skills at deciphering its meaning. What she uncovers is just the first piece of a deeper intrigue. As she follows its trail, Elisa will have to choose between the scoop of a lifetime and her own ethics. And she will find herself trapped in a series of tangled events deep in the heart of Rome. For this ancient city, known for its culture and art, also has a history of dark secrets and esoteric movements.  To survive these challenges, instinct and skills will not be enough.

Commonly known as Three Card Poker or Tricard Poker, 3 Card Pro combines the excitement of poker and the thrill of the casino in one game.  It is no surprise that it is quickly becoming one of the most popular casino games worldwide.  Adding 3 Card PRO to your growing collection PRO Series casino games will provide you the knowledge, strategy and training to become a poised player the next time you visit your favorite casino.  Sit at a Three Card Stud Poker table, and you will see three betting circles per player.  The top circle is for the pair-plus bonus bet, the middle for the ante, and the closest circle to the player is for the play or raise bet.  Using these circles, it is possible for a player, in essence, to play two poker games at once.  Three card stud poker does not use the same winning hierarchy as standard poker.  For example, it is more difficult to be dealt a straight with three cards than it is to be dealt a flush.  As you would expect from the PRO Series casino games, 3 Card PRO includes valuable training tools like our &#39;Ask the Dealer&#39; to determine your best odds to play the current hand.  Additionally, in depth stats are collected on your hands played so you can review your winning percentages and refine your winning strategies.  By playing 3 Card Pro, you can have hours of fun learning a new game if you have never played before, or you can hone your skills while playing one of your favorite casino games.
