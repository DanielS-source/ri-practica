The Story: In the world of Nysenia there was a centuries old war between the Humans of Ardania and the Undead of Mordena. During their last battle in the Bras Plains they have thrown enormous forces against each other. The conflict shattered the land and the impact was so huge that it threatened the existence of the world itself. Magicians from the Hidden Kingdom Lorelight decided to intervene and stop the madness of the raging kings. Their wizard leader - Elnan Wise Wand teleported himself in the center of the battle. From there, alone, he cast a spell with unseen power - it petrified everything in hundreds of miles. He managed to stop the battle but he payed for this with his life as the spell drew energy from his body. The huge battleground became still and silent. Echoes of the war were over. Only statues of thousands of warriors remained there. Both the kings of Humans and Undead were awed from the power of the spell. The sudden ending of their armies shocked them. The magician followers of Elnan sent them a message to let them know of the sacrifice of the wizard leader, and that Lorelight will not tolerate any more this war. The Kings had no other choice but to end the war and sign a peace treaty. But they also had to find another outlet for their hate for each other. That&#39;s how they started the BattleSpell tournament. Their legal and civilized way to continue fighting in a small barren territories near the Petrified Battlefield.
