The aim of the game is to find all 9 pieces of Blackbeard's map scattered across the entire Caribbean, to raise the pirate treasure and to set free the lovely mermaid being held hostage by the soldiers. TRADE GOODS: 16 beautiful but perilous Caribbean islands are waiting to be discovered. Each island is different, yet on all of them you can trade goods with Dimitri the Tradesman and so increase your supply of gold. PIMP YOUR PIRATE BOAT: On some islands, Herman the Shipwright operates a boatyard. Depending on how much gold they have, pirates can buy any kind of ship their hearts desire. Ships can be bought, repaired or upgraded here. The better the ship, the greater your chances of winning the sea battles against hostile soldiers. EXPLORE ISLANDS: On all 16 islands you can go on a tour of the island (jump &amp; run level), increase your supply of gold and tackle some unexpected surprises while you are at it. FIGHT SEA BATTLES and sea monsters: Before our hero Captain One-Eye is finally able to raise the treasure and rescue the mermaid, he first has to successfully complete 70 tricky missions.
