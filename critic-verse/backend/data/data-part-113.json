To play Word Search, find the hidden words in the puzzle and swipe them with your finger. Hidden words can appear in any orientation - up, down, left, right, or diagonally - and in either direction, forward or backward.

If you have trouble finding words, simply tap the &#34;Words&#34; button and reduce the level of difficulty on the puzzle to get more clues. Finally, if you just can&#39;t find one or more words, tap the &#34;Solution&#34; button and all the words in the puzzle will be revealed. Once all words are selected, you win!
