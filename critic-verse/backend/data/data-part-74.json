Military success is no longer made by major countries but by small and highly specialized mercenary forces. In \\\"SOLDNER - Secret Wars\\\" the player takes over the command of such a Special Forces team. As the Commander he leads a small high tech army consisting of soldiers, light armored vehicles, helicopters and VTOLS (Vertical Take Off and Landing Airplanes) to fulfill a wide variety of mission types. The players units are stationed on a multi purpose ship which is camouflaged as a merchantman to allow unrestrained travel of the seas to get their forces to the area of operation. The complete simulation of a complex political world system allows creating a dynamic campaign: each decision of the player, each success or failure has direct effect on the game flow. In addition the player has the ability to gain access to the latest weapon systems and technology, which currently exist in the research centers of the weapon industry only.

And the Queen reigning over all, resplendent in the Crown Jewels.\\r At least, that's the official plan. Unbeknownst to the celebrants thronging the city, a crisis has arisen: the Crown Jewels have been stolen from the Tower of London. If they're not recovered before the festivities begin, the theft will be exposed and the government will fall into international disgrace.\\r Only 48 hours remain to solve the crime. With Scotland Yard failing to make headway, the Prime Minister calls on Sherlock Holmes, the famous consulting detective. But riddles left at the scene of the crime include a direct challenge to Holmes, who suspects a deadly trap. To throw the scoundrel off his guard, Holmes turns the investigation over to you, his trusted cohort, Dr. Watson.\\r With Holmes by your side, you use your wits, intuition, and a myriad of clues to solve the riddles and piece together the mystery. Your search for the jewels and the villain leads you all over London, from the most popular tourist attractions to the seediest back alleys. As Big Ben strikes each successive hour and dangerous complications impede your progress, you realize you're facing that most dastardly of foes, Holmes's archnemesis... the vile Professor Moriarty.\\r Sherlock: The Riddle of the Crown Jewels is the first story in Infocom's new Immortal Legends series, developed by Challenge, Inc.
