But do they REALLY try to do anything different from each other? Mystery of the J-Werewolf does. A flying saucer landed on Earth and it's enigmatic pilot asks for help. Ghosts and monsters lurk inside his awesome custom painted flying saucer, but Eileen, the new ninja in town, is at the right place at the right time and so she gets the chance to go on an adventure that is as nostalgic as it is NEW. Inspired by really good classic games like Ninja Gaiden, Super Mario, Mega Man and Metroid, Mystery of the J-Werewolf was designed to be as confortable as holding an old NES controller, but also to use the modern features of the iOS devices in unique ways. A classic platformer made by someone who played lots of them. The old meets the new in this new spin on 2D sidescrollers. If you like Super Mario, Metroid, Ninja Gaiden or Mega Man, this is the 2D game for you. If you are completely tired of collecting stars and repeating the same stages over and over again for better scores, this is the 2D game for you.===UPDATE 2011-12-21I'm from Brazil, so my english is not that great.
