Modified Air Combat Heroes rise through the ranks by defeating rivals and unlocking customized parts and planes -- 180 over-the-top configurations possible across 11 planes -- for enhanced speed and weaponry.  Gamers will take to the skies for intense aerial racing action and deadly air-to-air combat throughout a variety of environments and can choose from multiple gameplay modes. Arcade mode is designed to throw gamers into the action as quickly as possible and, although only one plane will be available initially, progressing through the Career mode to unlock other planes will gradually give access to the full Arcade experience. Career mode consists of a collection of high-octane tournaments spread over various landscapes.  As gamers progress through their career from a Rookie through Pro, Ace, Elite and finally to a combat Hero, they'll gradually win access to enemies' planes and earn cash, which will enable players to upgrade capabilities and keep up with the competition.
