Each level will also feature a giant Boss item that players need to destroy in a certain amount of time to avoid getting penalized. At the end of each stage, each player will be rated by how eco-friendly or ego-friendly each stage was completed. The more eco-friendly, the higher the rating. Ratings help in unlocking various levels and modes. Spread across three different game modes, Trash Panic offers fun gaming for everyone. The Main Mode will take players progressively through six stages that increase in difficulty the further you advance. Vs. Mode allows two players to battle one another on the same screen. And lastly, Mission Mode offers mini-games for those who want to further their fun with a variety of waste management missions.
