If you work the band too hard, arrange poorly-attended gigs, and don't provide your band with the lifestyle they expect, you will have resignations on your hands.

To their dismay and horror, the American Sherman tank-crews quickly found out how inadequate and inferior their tanks were, especially against Germany's late model tanks. They were drastically out-gunned and out-armored by the far superior German tanks. On the positive side, the American tanks were faster, more maneuverable and far more reliable. The Allies had a greater number of tanks, very effective artillery and total air superiority. German columns were constantly harassed from the air as American Thunderbolts and British Typhoons rained horror upon them. These were some of the factors, along with the willingness of the American crews to take chances that initially avoided disaster. Fight everything in the German arsenal including the most notorious and lethal tanks such as Tigers and Panthers. Battle through over 50 missions in this fast-paced arcade-style shooter.
