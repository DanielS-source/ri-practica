Unlike standard poker games, Oasis Poker is played against the Dealer instead of against other players.  Oasis Poker is played in the following steps:  1) Player pays ante and cards are dealt.  2) Player has the option to pay ante amount and switch one card with a new one from the deck.  3) Player can place a bet equal to twice the ante amount or fold.  4a) If Dealer&#39;s Hand is Ace / King or better, then Dealer&#39;s hand qualifies. Both hands are compared and if Player wins, a Bet Payout is made based on the value of Player&#39;s hands. See &#34;Payouts&#34; table for more details.  4b) If Dealer&#39;s Hand is weaker than Ace / King, then Dealer&#39;s hand fails to qualify. Player has option to pay ante amount to have Dealer switch his highest value card for a new one from the deck. If Player doesn&#39;t want to do this, they receive an immediate payout equal to the ante amount.  Since Bet Payouts are only made when Dealer&#39;s hand qualifies, the Player might want to buy the Dealer a new card if the Player&#39;s hand is high enough (Part of the strategy of Oasis Poker is figuring out when it&#39;s worth doing).

Then you move them around by wiping the pieces horizontally or vertically or, if you have only one adjacent piece, by tapping on a free position. If you only have three tiles left, you can jump to any free position by tapping a piece and then a position or by dragging the piece.  Conventions for a tie: - 100 draws without closing a mill. - 3 times the exact same lineup.  Options: Tap on any light tile to let the artificial intelligence begin. Set the difficulty level &mdash; increasing from one to three &mdash; by tapping on the symbol in the top left corner. Abort the current game by tapping on the cross in the top right corner.  Handling: You don&#39;t have to drag the pieces, but you can. - Tap a position to place them. - Wipe them horizontally or vertically. - Tap a piece and then the new position on the board.

As the new Sheriff in charge of defending the town, hire a wild posse of Cowboys and Cowgirls for your fight against the undead hordes. Upgrade and reposition them to defend against wave after wave of zombies who are hell bent on destroying the town. Unlike most tower defense games, you need to protect your cowboys from attack by positioning them on rooftops. However, the Zombies destroy the buildings, diminishing the safe places you can choose to place Cowboys on. You will have to choose when to repair a building and when to abandon a building and fall back to a better position. If the zombies destroy all of buildings, they will come after the Sheriff and you lose.   Meet the Posse: Pistol Packin Cowboys - these young, dumb, sons-of-guns are your basic gun for hire. A good base unit with great upgrades to both speed and damage. Shotgun Shootin Cowboys - the Shotgun Shooters are older and wiser than their Pistol Packin brethren, and a little more ornery too. Shotgun Shootin Cowboys can blast multiple zombies at once. The Prospector - this crazy old coot has spent far too much time underground packin dirt in his ears. He can be a little reckless - tossing sticks of lit dyn-o-mite into a crowd of zombies - but he sure does get the job done. Fannie Smokely - the sharpest sharpshooter in Wild Ol Bill&#39;s Wildest of Wild West Shows! Fannie Smokely can shoot the stink off a dog at 800 yards with her trusty huntin&#39; rifle Sally May.
