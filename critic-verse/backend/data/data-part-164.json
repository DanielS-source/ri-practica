NOTE: Move your finger more slowly for finer adjustments.  Laze has two gameplay modes:  Training Mode:   Laze will feed you mazes (from a training library of 500 mazes) likely to be challenging for your your skill level, or you can choose the difficulty of new mazes with a slider in on the Settings page.  If you&#39;re stuck, get a hint about the location of a solution, or even a peek at the &#34;official&#34; solution, or skip the maze for now and come back to it later.  Challenge 100 Mode:   Solve 100 progressively more difficult mazes from easy to really hard.  No hints, no peeking !  You have to solve each maze before you go on to the next.

Use your finger to draw the best path for the ball, but stay in bounds or it will cost you a stroke! Sounds easy right? Oh, one more thing, the course DISAPPEARS WHEN YOU START TO DRAW.  Set in a school classroom, Invisible Links allows you to meet 6 fun classmates, each with their own unique style and drawing skills. Being the new kid in class, you&#39;ve got a lot to prove.  It turns out, the best way to earn respect with this crowd is to join in a secret note-passing game...  Gameplay consists of navigating SKETCHES WHICH TURN INVISIBLE as soon as they are touched (so the teacher won&#39;t see!). Use your memory skills and dexterity to master each twist and turn. Use two fingers to zoom, pan, and rotate the course to set up your perfect shot. By studying the course before it disappears, you will soon learn to beat your classmates at their own game, and claim the title of INVISIBLE LINKS class champ.  FEATURES  - Intuitively navigate levels using multi-touch controls - Over 60 beautifully hand-drawn levels - Hours of engaging gameplay - Gather hidden stars in each level - Navigate through Mountain Cliffs, Egyptian Pyramids, Heart Valves, Fiery Volcanos, and much more! - Addicting&hellip; oh, so addicting  TIPS - ZOOM IN!  - Practice your shots multiple times before taking a swing. If you can&#39;t do it in practice, you won&#39;t be able to do it when it really counts. - The courses disappear, but fortunately the paper has some landmark crinkles that stick around. Keep an eye on &#39;em. - Plan your shots. By using the edges of the screen, you&#39;ll be able to do a lot better!
