Much work has been done to make such a complex job fit inside the palm of your hand. You are the approach controller whose job is to manage arriving passenger jets at various busy airports.  Establish arriving aircraft onto 'final approach' as safely and efficiently as possible.  As in the real world of ATC, you must walk a very fine line between being cautious and being expeditious.  A top notch air traffic controller knows how to bring planes in 'tight', without breaking the 'three mile rule'.Keep all aircraft at least THREE MILES apart or at least 1000 FEET VERTICALLY apart.  That's your job in a nutshell!  Earn extra points by establishing the planes onto final approach without extra wasted space.  Air traffic controlling is achieved by assigning a mixture of three things: HEADING, SPEED, and ALTITUDE.  Use these three tools to achieve safety and efficiency.A successful air traffic controller must remain CALM, COOL and COLLECTED, known as the 'three C's'.

Prepare your defenses carefully; you wouldn&rsquo;t want all that evildoing to be for nothing. Features include:- Unique puzzle defense mechanics and level-up system- 50 levels, across 5 territories - 15 playable defender units and 5 special summons- Outstanding artwork- Compelling and beautiful original soundtrack, performed by a symphony orchestra Evilot goes beyond simple defense mechanics with the addition of puzzle elements, namely a grid based level-up system for units that adds an entire new level of gameplay. For example, if you place 3 units in a row or column, those units are combined into one single, more powerful unit. These mechanics diminish the need to collect resources, instead rewarding strategic planning and effective defensive positioning.Keep units tightly packed for more powerful upgrades and combos, or spread them out for a wider defensive line. You&rsquo;ll have to constantly evaluate your position, instead of the &quot;place and forget&quot; approach found in most defense titles. Evilot is a compelling twist on the defense genre that is easy to play, yet difficult to master.Game trailer:  <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>?v=7SC9J3Jd9n8Music trailer: <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/watch\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>?v=JtYDTM9iZBkVisit us at: <a href=\\\"http://www.evilot.comhttp\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://www.evilot.comhttp</a>://www.syrenaica.comLike us on Facebook: <a href=\\\"http://www.facebook.com/syrenaicagamesFollow\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://www.facebook.com/syrenaicagamesFollow</a> us on Twitter: <a href=\\\"http://www.twitter.com/Syrenaica\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://www.twitter.com/Syrenaica</a>*** This application is compatible with iPad 2 Wi-Fi, iPad 2 Wi-Fi + 3G, iPad (3rd generation), iPad Wi-Fi + 4G, iPad (4th generation), iPad Wi-Fi + Cellular (4th generation), iPad mini and iPad mini Wi-Fi + Cellular.
