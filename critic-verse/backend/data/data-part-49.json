Now you can finally enjoy this smash hit game on the iPhone. With over 50 million game plays on the web in 3 months this is an online classic in a portable format brought to you by the worlds biggest skill games community - King.com.    Amazon Survival is played in the deep rain forest surrounding the Amazon river. Your goal is to bring the blocks down so they are all beneath the surface. Save animals by bringing them down to the water for extra points. Enjoy the classic Time Attack mode and the all new Survival mode for more fun ways to enjoy this great puzzle game.    GAME RULES  Drop blocks to make groups of 4 or more of one colour in order to remove all blocks above the surface. You will move on to the next level when all blocks and animals are below the water line.   Power ups: The Colour Bomb is created when you make a 3-step or more combo. When used in a combo, the Colour Bomb will remove all blocks of its colour.   The Line Blast is created when you make a combo with 6 or more blocks. When used in a combo, it will remove a horizontal line. Be careful not to use this when you have animals on that line, or they will be lost!   Only two power ups can be stored at any time, so if you create more than two powerups at the same time, the latest one will be stored.   Black Blocks: The Black Blocks are only in your way. You cannot make combos with them, and the only way to get rid of them is by using line blasts. Black Blocks do not appear on the first levels, but get more and more common as you reach later levels.    GAME CONTROLS  Hold your finger on the screen and move it sideways to select which column to drop your next block in. Release the finger to drop. You can also switch place on the two blocks in the top block holder by clicking on it with your finger.  STRATEGY  Think before you drop your blocks, a long chain is worth a lot, both for the points and the powerups it will create. Work from the sides when possible. The score is increased for every level, but so is the amount of black blocks. This means that the first levels are more valuable than you might think.   Look for chains of 3 steps or more to create the precious colour bombs. Use your line blasts wisely, and don&rsquo;t just drop them off where they cannot be used to create combos.      ------------------------------------------------------------     GAME HIGHLIGHTS  2 Game modes: Time Attack and Survival  Local highscore list to keep track of your achievements  OS 3.0 compatibale  Multiple sound tracks  Multiple block design to discover        If you like this game visit King.com for hundreds of unique games and millions of players to meet and challenge.

He contemplates his favourite smash hits while being surrounded by beautiful nature. The only thing that makes him furious is when someone disturbs him in his hobby. Nowadays it&#39;s not easy to find empty, quiet beaches or virgin mountain hogbacks. Help the Rabbit and get rid of those dirty, filthy, smelly and noisy tourists. Remember - show no mercy and take no prisoners!   But be careful. There are beings and things that are dangerous even for the Rabbit (for the time being): While smashing chicks on the beach one must slide away from lifeguards, sharks, toilets, stones and piers. Several obstacles are also looming when going down the slope. Don&#39;t get too familiar with shepherds, yetis, trees, snowmans and cottages there.    Scoring  You get points for each second spent on a level - the longer you play the bigger the score. You can get additional points for tearing down every tourist you catch. Extra points are given for bonus characters which are marked with green arrows. Exterminate 10 of them and you will get 500000 points!    Time bonus  Watch the red Time Bonus meter. If you manage to survive till the red marker disappears, then the amount of Rabbits in the ride increases. From this moment, all points are doubled. Next time you get three rabbits and triple the points. Hold on for a moment longer and you&#39;ll transform into Tornado! As Tornado, you are invincible and can collect all level bonuses - you are the master of vengeance and fury!     Controls within the game  Classic controls: Tap icon on left - move left.  Tap icon on right - move right.    Gesture controls: The rabbit will follow the movement of your finger on screen.  Right bottom screen corner &ndash; pause.
