Thanks to the official ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 content, Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 features licensed players, including world cricket stars Andrew Flintoff, Ricky Ponting, Mahendra Dhoni, Muttiah Muralitharan and of course, Brian Lara himself. In addition to players, the game leads with a dedicated ICC Cricket World Cup 2007 mode featuring all the official teams, stadia, kits and equipment of the tournament. Further modes include a fully licensed ICC Champions' Trophy competition and exhibition matches including One Day Games, Test Matches and exciting 20-over run fests. When you want to get competitive for real, Brian Lara International Cricket 2007 will deliver with online competitive play on PC (LAN and online) and Xbox Live. BLIC 2007 adds extra depth to the series' complete batting, bowling and fielding experience whilst retaining its trademark accessible playability. The batting play sees the introduction of subtle edges, sweepshots and the ability to use your feet to dance down wicket and smash the ball over the boundary for six. Bowling sees an improved set of delivery types, thanks to changes in the way the ball swings in the air and reacts off the pitch, showcasing Shane Warne's huge variation of spinning deliveries and Steve Harmison's raw pace and even reverse swing as the ball degrades. In Fielding, there's a new reflex-testing slip catch system and players can now be run out at both ends and be stumped by alert wicket keepers.

Gamers can use offensive and defensive attacks as they battle for the lead and careen through real-world track locations ranging from L.A. and San Francisco to the streets of Hackney, UK and the treacherous roads of Barcelona, Spain.

This unique story-driving social network evolves dynamically as players compete in different races, make new friends, rivals and fans, and connect with other racers both in-game and in real life. Looking beyond Blur's single player story, gamers can engage in competitive and team-based multiplayer races with up to 20 players online, or on a single console via 4-player split-screen. Bizarre has also introduced Blur\\u2019s original social gaming experience - Custom Groups, where anyone can create unique multiplayer modes based on their favorite ways to play the game.

New Version - Casual Untimed Mode.  --------------------  What do you get when you cross Bejeweled with Video Poker?  You get a fun and original match style puzzle game. Poker Stacks.  Yes, someone has finally successfully mutated Gem Swapping Games like Puzzle Quest with the great game of Poker. Others have tried but now a truly fun and original game is here. The next generation of Puzzle Game now on your iPhone or iPod Touch.   Poker Stacks is based on games like Bejeweled 2, Tetris, or Bubbles and builds on them in that you are trying to match real poker hands to clear the board and move to the next level.   You do not need to know or be good at poker to love this game. You just have to be comfortable with the poker hands, and we can even teach you those...  If you love games like Trism, Fuzzle, Poker Dice, Glyph, or Aurora Feint and/or you enjoy Video Poker or Texas Hold &#39;Em you have to give Poker Stacks a try.   Features ---------------------- * Clean attractive game board and animations that don&#39;t over distract from game play. * 3 Game Modes with 2 Difficulty settings * Advancing levels of play with greater challenges. * Help system  * Sound on/off - And listen to your own music. * High Score System. * Saves Game Progress on Exit - Continue after a call or if you need to pause.   Game Play ---------------------- It is suggested that you read the help screen for more information before playing.   The idea is to select poker hands to clear the board so that all of the remaining card tiles fall into the given bottom rows(arrows on the side) before the time runs out. Advancing levels bring new challenges.   Slide your finger over up to 5 cards to select the poker hands. Order isn&#39;t important so straights dont have to be in order and pairs dont have to be right next to each other. Tiles not directly involved in the hand&#39;s scoring,&#39;kicker cards&#39;, will remain on the board. Bigger hands mean bigger points.   You can also swap a piece exactly once with an adjacent piece between each hand played. The back will then turn blue showing the swapped pieces are frozen in place.   Finally, you can slide pieces vertically into open spaces. Gravity will pull them down if it can.   Those are the rules, its up to you to figure out the best strategies.   Who has the high score on your device?  What they&#39;re saying ----------------------  &#34;it is fantastic!!!!!! ... Seriously, this game is great! ...  In all, it is a great game that requires a good deal of thought and strategy.
