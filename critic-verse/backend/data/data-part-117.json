Escape is impossible...\\\" And all of this is DISPLAYED ON SCREEN, in vivid colors and at speeds previously impossible for the IBM PC. With the complexity of a text adventure and the graphics and action of an arcade game, ICON challenges you to begin an epic quest.   Enter the realm of myth. Your journey through the dungeon worlds in search of the mystic icons is more than an adventure. It is a true quest. Be warned, your role is not just to kill monsters and pick up gold. The goal of your quest has a spiritual dimension -- to transcend the succession of dungeon worlds and escape the endless cycle of births and deaths. But the way is not easy. You must discover your destiny and find a path to it. You must master the virtues of a true cosmic traveller and pass the tests that qualify you to complete your ultimate fate.   THE SECRET OF MACROCOM GAMES What makes Macrocom simulations unique? To start with, they are 100% graphic. You are in action, not reading about action. Macrocom simulations involve you more in the story than other computer games for the IBM PC do. Our programs don't come between you and the story.   SUPERIOR GRAPHICS  The secret is our special graphic process. We are not limited to the single display page and four color business graphics palette of the IBM. Dozens of beings can be on the screen at the same time -- each moving and behaving independently.  And seeing is believing... Macrocom games give you more colors andmore resolution than you have ever seen on a standard IBM -- sixteen colors at 320 x 200 dot resolution.   EXCLUSIVELY FOR IBM PCs AND IBM COMPATIBLES Macrocom can make your IBM PC do more because our programs aren't designed for Ataris or Commodores but for you and your IBM. Macrocom takes advantage of the greater memory of your IBM PC and of its special, undocumented graphic capabilities.   ALL THE WORLD IS A STAGE And you are a player on it. There's more to Macrocom simulations -- epic scope and plots, mythic situations, and remarkably realistic environments. Computer adventure plots don't have to resemble computer programs. Quit fighting with programs that make you think like a programmer. Play a Macrocom simulation and immerse yourself in a microworld created by dramatists.\", \"genre\": [\"Western RPG\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": null, \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-140979-13.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-140979-13.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": null, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Macrocom (Developer)\", \"Sir-Tech Software Inc.

The Lord of the Games (aka LOG) is tired of the petty squabbling between Banjo and the evil witch Gruntilda (aka Grunty) over the years, and has arranged a showdown to decide the rightful owner of Spiral Mountain. Claiming to have created every video game ever made, LOG has built the game worlds in which the contest's challenges take place. Banjo must complete LOG's challenges to win, while Grunty tries to stop him using every method her devious mind can muster. Throughout their adventure, players create their own abilities by building vehicles for Banjo to pilot over land, water and air. Vehicle parts, which range from simple devices such as engines and wheels to more unusual equipment such as springs and egg guns, are earned and collected throughout the game. Players use their imagination to combine parts in any order to create whatever vehicle they choose. LOG's challenges have one goal, but players' choice of vehicle and tactics determine how they get there. By exploring worlds and solving puzzles, players both young and old are rewarded with more advanced and diverse vehicle parts in their quest to defeat Grunty once and for all. You can play through the adventure alone in the single-player campaign, or play with friends in competitive or cooperative challenges on your own or in teams.
