Gain points by correctly and quickly identifying whether the associated feeling is a &lsquo;match&rsquo; or a &lsquo;mis-match&rsquo; to the scene.  Science There is increasing evidence that focusing on positive information boosts positive feelings and wellbeing, while attending to negative information makes you feel more stressed and vulnerable (1,2). Optimists will tend to avoid focusing directly on negative images, and show reduced stress and arousal (3,4). Both images and words provide powerful input about positive feelings in the world around us. Training to tune into positve image-word associations will help build a cycle of positivity, and flow on effects to reducing stress and boosting wellbeing and resilience (1-4)   1.
