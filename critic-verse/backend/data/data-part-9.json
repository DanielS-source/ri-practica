When you surround a group of one color with another color, the surrounded group clears, scoring points. The surrounding tiles flip to the color of the tiles that were cleared. When tiles flip color, chain reactions are possible. Larger groups and longer chain reactions are awarded more points.\\r \\r As the game progresses, more colors are added to the pool, making the grid more and more constrained. Pressure builds until the grid finally fills up, and the game ends.\\r \\r Despite this mounting pressure, the game doesn't have a frantic feel, because you have as much time as you want to make each move. Whereas games like Tetris depend on getting faster and faster to be challenging, Primrose derives deep challenge from inherent properties of its mechanics.\\r \\r But comparisons with Tetris aren't very helpful, because Primrose does not have you dropping tiles down a well. Primrose also doesn't have you swapping adjacent tiles like so many match-3 games. So what comparison is useful? Primrose is a small bit like Go and Othello (if either of those were one-player games), a small bit like Lights Out, and a big bit like nothing you've every played before.\", \"genre\": [\"Matching Puzzle\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-02-19\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116000-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116000-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Jason Rohrer (Publisher)\", \"Jason Rohrer (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\", \"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Greedy Words (2006)\", \"title_search\": \"greedy words 2006\", \"title_keyword\": \"greedy words 2006\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/greedy-words-2006/\", \"summary\": null, \"genre\": [\"Logic Puzzle\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2006-03-23\", \"images\": [], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Toybox Games (Developer)\", \"Toybox Games (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": \"E\"}", "{\"title\": \"Juggernaut: The New Story for Quake II\", \"title_search\": \"juggernaut the new story for quake ii\", \"title_keyword\": \"juggernaut the new story for quake ii\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/juggernaut-the-new-story-for-quake-ii/\", \"summary\": \"Juggernaut propels you through the ultimate conversion of Quake II, with all new levels, monsters and weapons plus over 650 all-new exclusive textures.\\r - Continue the challenge of Quake II with a whole new story and levels.\\r - 13 new single-player & death match levels including ice caves, steamy jungles & The Juggernaut Complex.\\r - 5 new monsters, all with their own unique strengths & weaknesses.\\r - 2 all-new deadly weapons, the EMP & blade guns.\\r - Over 650 all-new, original 3-D modeled textures for high clarity and realistic movement.\\r - All original maps and new sounds bring the distinct Juggernaut environments to life!\", \"genre\": [\"FPS\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": null, \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-115274-13.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-115274-13.jpg\"], \"video\": \"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/manifests/igURASpW.m3u8\", \"video_thumbnail\": \"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/igURASpW/poster.jpg?width=320\", \"video_type\": \"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl\", \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": [\"Carly Staehlin-Taylor (Cast: Computers,female player character)\", \"Marty Stratton (Produced By: producer)\", \"Tim Willits (Produced By: executive producer: Nintendo 64 version)\", \"David Alexander (Music)\", \"Bill Brown (Music)\", \"Sonic Mayhem (Music)\", \"Rob Zombie (Music)\", \"Gregory Hainer (Sound: re-recording mixer,sound designer)\", \"Tom Ozanich (Sound: supervising sound designer)\", \"Carole Ruggier (Casting Director)\", \"Brandon James (Art Department: level designer)\", \"John Carmack (lead programmer)\", \"Todd Hollenshead (business)\", \"Katherine Anna Kang (business)\", \"Tim Willits (level designer)\", \"Bill Brown (Music Department: composer: additional music)\"], \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Canopy Games (Developer)\", \"Head Games Publishing (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"My Stop Smoking Coach: Allen Carr's EasyWay\", \"title_search\": \"my stop smoking coach allen carrs easyway\", \"title_keyword\": \"my stop smoking coach allen carrs easyway\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/my-stop-smoking-coach-allen-carrs-easyway/\", \"summary\": \"Brought to an exciting interactive platform, the Nintendo DS, Allen Carr's Easyway method will take on a whole new dimension.

The moment you step into Carnival Games you can almost smell the funnel cakes as you are greeted by the barker and the sights and sounds of a classic carnival. The game was built from the ground up to take full advantage of the capabilities of the Wii Remote, so the flick of your wrist in Alley Ball makes the difference between scoring an impressive 100 points and a lowly 10 points. The ability to pound the Wii Remote like a sledgehammer with the right mix of power and finesse in Test of Strength determines whether you are a Contender or a Grandma.\", \"genre\": [\"Party\"], \"metascore\": \"56\", \"critic_reviews\": 27, \"user_score\": \"4.9\", \"user_reviews\": 13, \"release_date\": \"2007-08-28\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-595802-13.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-595802-13.jpg\"], \"video\": \"https://mt-rv-v1.gamespot.com/vr/2019/05/28/carnivalgames_wii_gp_052207m1_2000_1000,master.m3u8\", \"video_thumbnail\": \"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/tztOdUSW/poster.jpg?width=320\", \"video_type\": \"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl\", \"sentiment\": \"Mixed or average\", \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\", \"Europe\", \"Australia\"], \"companies\": [\"Global Star Software (Publisher)\", \"Cat Daddy Games (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"Wii\", \"DS\", \"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": \"E\"}", "{\"title\": \"Aegis Wing\", \"title_search\": \"aegis wing\", \"title_keyword\": \"aegis wing\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/aegis-wing/\", \"summary\": \"[Xbox Live Arcade]  Aegis Wing is a side-scrolling space combat game reminiscent of classic eighties arcade hits. It features alien-busting action, slick graphics, an orchestral soundtrack, and devastating power-ups. Also included is a unique cooperative mode of play in which up to three additional players can \\\"attach\\\" to the leader's ship and become independent, 360-degree gun turrets. Get ready for an action-retro 2-D sci-fi side scrolling shooter, similar to \\\"Gradius\\\" or \\\"Defender.\\\" Up to four players can compete on the same console or on Xbox Live. Attach to each other, and super weapon powers grow as more players attach. After attaching, there's one pilot and each rider rotates fire via a 360-degree gun turret. Wield four super weapons, including the Hades Beam (kills everything in it\\u2019s path), the Gordon Burst (EMP pulse that kills all bullets and short circuits enemies), the Arcus Missile (heat-seeking missiles), and Lambda Shield (allows bullets to be deflected and used against the enemies).
