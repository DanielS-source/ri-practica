A tornado suddenly strikes a small farm in Kansas, savagely uprooting Dorothy and Toto with just one gust. After hours of dancing around in the bushel of wind, the pair eventually settles in an unfamiliar countryside. It is here Dorothy learns that the only way to return home is by following the ominous voice calling out to her to the end of the Yellow Brick Road. On her journey, Dorothy encounters some unlikely characters who eventually decide to join her on her quest. Dorothy and Toto, together with their newfound companions - the Scarecrow, Lion and Tin Man- embark on an enchanting voyage filled with many obstacles. Upon reaching the castle at the end of the Yellow Brick Road, the group learns from a mysterious wizard that the magical land has been taken over by four evil witches that are running amuck.

They are only about 4 sentences. Here&#39;s what you need to know:  -&gt;The throttle is automatically controlled for you.  -&gt;You drag the collective DOWN to INCREASE pitch... a situation that is ergonomically the same as real helos. REMEMBER: IN THE REAL HELO, YOU PULL THE COLLECTIVE HANDLE &gt;TOWARDS&lt;YOU TO INCREASE COLLECTIVE. ON X-PLANE FOR IPHONE, YOU DRAG YOUR THUMB &gt;TOWARDS&lt; YOU TO INCREASE COLLECTIVE, A SITUATION WITH THE CLOSEST ERGONOMIC SIMILARITY TO THE REAL MACHINE! This does mean that you drag the little slider TOWARDS you, or DOWN, to INCREASE collective.  And now, on with the show! X-Plane Helicopter is a new version of X-Plane that lets you realistically fly Helicopters!  You get some very interesting birds to fly, including:  The Robinson R-22: The lightweight, efficient trainer. The Bell-206: The turbine-powered mainstay of the helicopter fleet. The BlackHawk: The massive military cargo and troop mover. The Sea King: The huge land/sea rescue helicopter.  These fascinating and varied machines are modeled very realistically, so the flight you get on the iPhone is actually almost as realistic as the full FAA-Certified flight-model used in X-Plane for desktop... You get almost all the flight-model realism of this certified sim: On your phone.  As well, the flight-area is the Grand Canyon, giving you amazing views as you fly your helos across (and into!) the various canyons and valleys, giving the most visually-stunning simulation we have yet released, with the most challenging and realistic flight-models we have produced for iPhone so far.  Now, a quick lesson: The COLLECTIVE control is on the LEFT of the iPhone screen... drag it DOWN GENTLY to INCREASE the pitch of the main rotor, thus causing the helo to lift. As you drag this collective down, you will notice that the throttle AUTOMATICALLY increases on the right side of the screen. This is because the throttle governor automatically increases the engine power to maintain the desired rotor RPM as you increase the load on the rotor by increasing the rotor pitch. This is how the real helicopters work, and how we simulate them on the iPhone.  The tail-rotor is controlled for you automatically, since your iPhone does not have any anti-torque pedals plugged into it. ;-)  If you are ready for the best scenery and most fascinating and challenging flight model available on the iPhone, then you are ready for X-Plane-Helicopter.\", \"genre\": [\"Aircraft Sim\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2008-12-11\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116132-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116132-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Laminar Research (Publisher)\", \"Laminar Research (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"X-Plane REMOTE\", \"title_search\": \"xplane remote\", \"title_keyword\": \"xplane remote\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/x-plane-remote/\", \"summary\": \"This is X-Plane REMOTE, a REALLY cool app to run with your desktop-computer copy of X-Plane!

NOTE: THIS APP &lt;&lt;&lt;DOES&gt;&gt;&gt; WORK WITH OLD POWER-PC MACS, DESPITE THE OBSOLETE REVIEW TO THE CONTRARY. Earlier versions of X-Plane had to be Intel-only, but we now work with old Power-PC as well.  Here is how it works: You can use your IPHONE or IPODTOUCH as WIRELESS JOYSTICK for your desktop computer flying X-Plane! This is amazing because if you are ever traveling and do NOT have you joystick with you, you can simply use your iPhone or iPod Touch as a WIRELESS JOYSTICK for your copy of X-Plane on your laptop or desktop Mac or PC! COOL!  And it gets better: You can control the throttle, flaps, speedbrakes, landing gear, and brakes on your desktop or laptop copy of X-Plane with this app, just like you do in the iPhone version of X-Plane!  As well, X-Plane REMOTE can show a General Aviation, Biz-Aviation, EFIS, or Space-Shuttle COCKPITS on your iPhone, so you can fly your desktop or laptop copy of X-Plane in FULL-SCREEN scenery mode, seeing the instrument panel of your choice on your phone as you tilt your phone to fly X-Plane!  AS WELL, X-Plane REMOTE can simply show a MOVING MAP, letting your iPod or iPhone turn into a simple external moving map for X-Plane as you fly.  One amazing use for this would be to use your iPhone as a wireless joystick and and external moving map to let you have a wireless joystick and wireless moving map whenever you travel with your laptop! (The AIRPORT on your laptop will send the signals to your iPhone!)   Another amazing use could be this: Imagine you hook up your desktop Mac or PC to a HUGE flat-screen TV in your living room, and set to AMAZING res, running in full-screen (no instrument panel!) mode, so yo have AMAZING scenery filling your entire TV... then, via airport, use your iPhone as a wireless joystick and instrument panel... with the throttles, flaps, speedbrakes, gear, brakes, and full instrument panel displays on your iPhone, you have all the controls and instruments to do a full flying regime, from sight-seeing to touch-and-gos to a FULL INSTRUMENT APPROACH PROCEDURES, INCLUDING ILS AND VOR APPROACHES.  ...And, to top it all off, we have the SPACE SHUTTLE panel on your iPhone as well, so you can fly full (REALISTIC!)
