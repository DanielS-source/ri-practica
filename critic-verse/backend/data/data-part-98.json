This Physics-Platformer game will keep you entertained. It is easy to pick up, and hard to put down. Give it a try, as for the time being, Jump Daisy Jump is a free game!  Instructions: When Daisy has both boots planted on the ground, you can drag her down to compress the springs. Once you release her, she will jump up. To jump sideways, drag down and to a side to make her tilt. Then release and she will jump in the direction of the tilt.  To complete a level, pick up all flowers and stars from the level, and then proceed to the finish flag.  Do not let Daisy tip over, because once she is no longer upright, this poor dairy cow will have to start all over. Mooo!  Jump Daisy Jump is a game by Bram Stolk, music by Jonathan Geer.\", \"genre\": [\"Adventure\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-09-19\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-165316-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-165316-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Abraham Stolk (Developer)\", \"Abraham Stolk (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Planet Stronghold\", \"title_search\": \"planet stronghold\", \"title_keyword\": \"planet stronghold\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/planet-stronghold/\", \"summary\": \"Planet Stronghold is a sci-fi role-playing game with a turn-based combat system.\\r \\r You take the role of a young, new recruit that somehow gets assigned to the most well-known, and well-defended, human outpost in the whole galaxy: Planet Stronghold.\\r \\r As the story goes on, you'll have to choose a side in a a war that will change the destiny of the planet, and of humankind, forever.\\r \\r GAME FEATURES:\\r \\r - Play as male or female\\r - Four different character classes\\r - Eight NPCs will join you in the battle\\r - Detailed battles with many tactical choices\\r - Over 40 unique enemies to fight including some &quot;boss fights&quot;\\r - Three optional romance endings for each gender for a total of 6 different romance endings\\r - Lots of quests and side-quests to solve: over 50h of gameplay!\\r - Dynamic story that changes based on your choices\\r - Use non-combat skills like Explosives, Science, Sneak to solve some situation without resorting to combat\\r - Lots of unique weapons and armor\", \"genre\": [\"JRPG\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": \"7.0\", \"user_reviews\": 5, \"release_date\": \"2011-02-27\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-189925-52.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-189925-52.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Winter Wolves Game Studio (Developer)\", \"Winter Wolves Game Studio (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\", \"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"YAHTZEE HD\", \"title_search\": \"yahtzee hd\", \"title_keyword\": \"yahtzee hd\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/yahtzee-hd/\", \"summary\": \"ROLL WITH THE ORIGINAL BEST-SELLING FAMILY FAVORITE &ndash; DESIGNED JUST FOR iPAD&trade;!
