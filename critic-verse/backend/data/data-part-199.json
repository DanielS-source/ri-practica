Adding to the challenge, you'll find that some cubes have different properties, making tosses tricky and further threatening the stability of the Fallos.

The cars could spiral out of control; causing nausea, whiplash, or sudden death.Our roller coasters use a realistic lift hill cable to pull the cars to the peak of the track.  Once the cars reach the peak, potential energy accumulated by the rise in height transfers to kinetic energy and the cars race downwards.  Some energy is lost to friction on the track itself.  The effects of gravity are taken into account to increase speed and accelerations accurately.  You can experience several G's of force on high-speed turns!iRollerCoaster features:- Advanced OpenGL graphics- Music and sound effects- Online high score database- High-resolution textures- Made for iPhone 4, iPad, iPhone 3G, 3Gs, and iPod Touch (all versions)iRollerCoaster 2 is brought to you by the makers of World Winter Games and iBASEjump.Have fun with iRollerCoaster 2 and enjoy the ride!\", \"genre\": [\"Racing\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2011-05-06\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-190551-52.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-190551-52.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Sea Venture LLC (Publisher)\", \"Sea Venture LLC (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"onEscapee\", \"title_search\": \"onescapee\", \"title_keyword\": \"onescapee\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/onescapee/\", \"summary\": null, \"genre\": [\"Action\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": null, \"images\": [], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Sadeness Software (Publisher)\", \"Invictus Games (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Nisemon Mahjong\", \"title_search\": \"nisemon mahjong\", \"title_keyword\": \"nisemon mahjong\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/nisemon-mahjong/\", \"summary\": null, \"genre\": [\"Board\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2000-12-15\", \"images\": [], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": null, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"Japan\"], \"companies\": [\"Prime System (Publisher)\", \"Prime System (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Xonotic\", \"title_search\": \"xonotic\", \"title_keyword\": \"xonotic\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/xonotic/\", \"summary\": \"Xonotic is a free (GPL), fast-paced first-person shooter that works on Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX and Linux.

The graphics are geometrical, and the pace is sometimes frenzied.    Two features set Transcend apart from other games. First, its dynamic graphical engine, which can smoothly morph from one complex shape to another, produces striking displays. Combining these dynamic shapes with subtle randomizations makes each play through a Transcend level visually different from the last. The second novel feature is Transcend's musical power-up system. As you play through a level, you are simultaneously assembling an abstract visual collage and arranging a unique piece of music.
