Fancy yourself an Indiana Jones type of adventurer, finding valuable hidden treasures that others have unsuccessfully searched for?  Maybe a good, old fashioned mystery is just the ticket for you.   &ldquo;The Stone of Destiny&rdquo; has something for every adventurous spirit in search of intrigue.  Explore the foreboding ruins of mystic temples and libraries or investigate the ancient altar where a precious object may be cleverly hidden. You never know where objects may be found, you&rsquo;ll have to keep an open mind and be thorough. The yellowed map of the world may even lead you to the briny depths in search a long forgotten shipwreck.   Every level you are given the list of objects to find. Sometimes instead of looking for items by their names, you seek them by their silhouettes. After clearing each set of locations, you pass through a portal that leads you further down the path to the Stone. Each portal presents you with 3D puzzles such as moving sarcophagi, placing rocks into their respective pillars, rearranging symbols and exclusive rune-drawing between levels.    You&rsquo;ll love the beautiful, high resolution graphics and ease of playing that this app offers.  If you can tap a screen, you can interact with it. Generally, &#34;The Stone of Destiny HD&#34; gives players the feel of participating in old-school adventures like in Indiana Jones movies.
