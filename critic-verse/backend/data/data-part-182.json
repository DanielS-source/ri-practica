Wii Play's nine different games are the perfect introduction to what the Wii Remote can do: Shooting Range - A modern version of the Nintendo classic Duck Hunt. Shoot the targets on the screen simply by aiming your Wii Remote. Find Mii - Can you spot a face in the crowd? Use your Wii Remote to point out the correct Mii characters as quickly as you can. Table Tennis - How long can you ping pong? Use your Wii Remote like a paddle to bat the ball and try to beat the computer or human opponent. Pose Mii - Twist the Wii Remote to rotate the Mii characters and quickly slot them into the correct positions as they fall down the screen. Laser Hockey - Tilt and turn the Wii Remote to bash the puck into the opponent's goal, in this high-speed arcade-style game. Billiards - In this version of Nine Ball, aim the Wii Remote at the screen to line up your shot, then pull back and push forward to strike the ball. Fishing - Move the Wii Remote like a rod: dip the hook in the water, wait for the fish to bite (the controller will rumble) and pull back hard to land it. Charge - Take the bull by the horns! Steer your wild steer by holding the Wii Remote sideways, as if gripping reins, and topple scarecrows to score points. Tanks - Take control of a tank with the Wii Remote; aim the cannon, bounce shells off walls, and blast your opponent to bits.

the battle for Earth as they choose to protect it as Autobots or destroy it as Decepticons. Players experience the unstoppable power and massive scale of their favorite Robots in Disguise such as BumbleBee, Barricade and others. As the Transformers robot's war comes to Earth, gamers make the choice to join the Autobots in protecting our planet or to join the Decepticons in destroying it. With dual campaigns, the fate of the world is in players' hands. Instantly change from a larger than life robot to a high-powered vehicle such as a sports car, fighter jet or helicopter. Players crush, topple and wreck every object, including buildings and vehicles, in their path or use the objects as weapons. An unprecedented line-up lets gamers experience the massive scale, unique abilities and sheer strength of an army of characters from the Transformers universe when they choose to play as Optimus Prime, Megatron, Ironhide, Starscream, BumbleBee and more. For head-to-head battles, fans engage in melee combat that reflects each Transformers robot's character, scale, weight and power along with melee weapons and special moves unique to each character. The game's ranged combat offers a wide array of projective weapons designed to take out enemies from afar.
