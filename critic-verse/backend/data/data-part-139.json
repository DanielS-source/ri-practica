But even if there were, Containment: The Zombie Puzzler would be the best one. You don't match 3 of anything. There are no abstract objects that you have to put together. You surround zombies with 4 of the same unit, and destroy them. The zombies, not the units.\\r \\r DIFFERENT UNITS KILL ZOMBIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS\\r Actually, most of the time the zombies end up just getting shot. But they get shot in brutal ways by shotguns, M-16s, and handguns, depending on what type of unit you surround them with. If they still don't learn their lesson (and let's be honest, zombies usually don't learn lessons) a nice bonesaw might do the trick. \\r \\r NO, SERIOUSLY, IN REALLY DIFFERENT WAYS\\r Surrounding zombies with cops gets you a sniper shot item. You can use this item to instantly take out a zombie. Prefer something less surgical? Then surround those undead jerks with soldiers, and you'll get a grenade. Want something MORE surgical? Then surround the shambling horde with doctors and you'll get a suit that resists infection. \\r \\r THAT'S RIGHT, WE SAID INFECTION\\r But whatever you do to stop the zombie outbreak, you'd better do it fast. Every time you make a move, the zombies get closer to infecting nearby units. How can you even the odds? By using those items we mentioned a few sentences ago. You'll also drop giant objects from the sky, electrocute zombies with a lightning rod, and much, much more.\\r \\r OH, AND DON'T FORGET THE BOSS BATTLES\\r The zombies don't play fair. By themselves, the regular zombies are bad enough. But over the course of Containment: The Zombie Puzzler, you'll encounter a whole mess of different enemy types, including some killer boss fights. Only by using every trick in the book (along with new tricks that you'll discover in each stage) will you survive the zombie apocalypse. \\r \\r BUT WAIT, THERE\\u2019S MORE\\r Like an epic campaign mode with branching paths and over a hundred stages. Like Game Center integration so you can relive your past glories on a pretty wood and felt background.
