Instructions: Tap your screen and drag each element to arrange them. The elements counter each other out, so the goal is to keep them in equilibrium!   How it Works: - Water (rain) helps the trees to grow and gets rid of dry land. But let it rain too much and you will have excess water on the land. - Sun reduces this excess water on the land, but too much of it will create excess dust. - Air (wind) reduces the growth of trees, makes the land cracked and dry, but it also blows away the excess dust.  In addition: - Items will fall randomly as you increase your score. Tapping on the items will help you to restore the earth&#39;s balance.
