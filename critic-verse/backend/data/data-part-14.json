The goal is to &#34;catch&#34; all of the colored pulses emitted from the orb at the center of the screen. You can be guided by either sight or sound as you rotate your iPhone or iPod Touch in sync with the ever quickening pulses.  GAMEPLAY A pulse can appear in any of four differently colored quadrants, and it will travel from the central orb to the outermost rung of its quadrant. A pulse in the outermost rung must be caught by activating that quadrant&#39;s paddle. The way this is achieved depends on the current control mode.  As you progress, the speed at which pulses are emitted increases. The orb&#39;s shifting colors (not visible in Blind Mode) become invaluable later in the game, as they show the color and quadrant of the next pulse. Additionally, a newly emitted pulse will play a tone unique to its quadrant.  If a pulse is not caught, it is counted as a miss. After three misses, the game is over, and the number of pulses caught is displayed. Just tap the screen to play another round, or submit your high score and see how you rank.   There are four Control Modes in Pulse:  ROTATE MODE The device is held perpendicular to the floor, and pulses are caught by rotating it so that the desired quadrant is pointing downward. For example, a violet pulse would be caught by holding the device normally (vertically, in portrait mode), while a green pulse would require that the device be turned upside-down.  TILT MODE The device is held flat, and quadrants are activated by slightly tilting the device in the direction of the incoming pulse. This mode is easier to handle than Rotate mode.  ROTATE BLIND and TILT BLIND The two Blind Modes follow the same control rules, but only the paddle is visible. You must rely on recognizing the tone of the pulse emitted, so you&#39;ll have to first spend some time getting familiar with game sounds in the standard Rotate and Tilt Modes.  NOTE: If you tend to have butterfingers, be aware that you may drop your iPhone/iPod while playing this game. For this reason, it is recommended that you not play Pulse while on a boat, at the top of the Eiffel Tower, or in the middle of a skydiving jump.

HOW TO PLAY  Touch Yumster and draw his path through the fruits of the same color. Drawing the path is similar to Flight Control or Harbour Master (you draw then watch) but with moving background. If you accidentally eat the fruit not of his color, Yumster will not be able to digest it and leave a poop that must be avoided at the next round. Change your color to eat fruits of a different color when you&#39;re ready. The longer you play, the faster Yumster crawls!  ?
