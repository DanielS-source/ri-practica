The game has two qualities that make it very addictive to play: it&rsquo;s simple and it&rsquo;s aggravating.   As you progress through the 18 fun levels you find more and more obstacles around which you have to maneuver through to secure the new moon into its orbit. Or, take on the Endless Mode to challenge and track the progress your friends or even the whole world on the leaderboards to see who is the best at raising the Moon up to the sky.

Here&#39;s a small sample of some of the positive reviews.  &#34;...Incredible Technologies&rsquo; iQuarters ($1.99) comes off as a pretty fun iPhone game, whether or not you&rsquo;re a fan of the game, or even if you&rsquo;ve ever played it before.&#34;  &#34;There was clearly a good deal of effort put into iQuarters, and it shows in every aspect of this quality game.&#34; --appolicious advisor  &#34;The graphics and physics in iQuarters make it so much fun and realistic. The 12 different scenes keep the game buzzing, and the trick shots add that extra bit of flavor. I think that iQuarters is an excellent example of iPad application development, and it is perfect to play anytime.&#34; --iPhone Footprint  &#34;iQuarters could easily be a new source of boasting for competitive friends, but even as a casual time-waster it&#39;s a tonne of fun thanks to the relaxed physics that allow you to attempt wild shots.&#34; --App Spy  &#34;I have been surprised to how often I&rsquo;ve been coming back to iQuarters again and again in an attempt to beat my previous scores and with that kind of addiction they must be doing something right!

Legend has it that over 642 million Chinese play Tichu nearly every day! I don&#39;t know about that. All I know is that Tichu might very well be the world&#39;s best card game.  Tichu is a partnership game for four players where partners battle to be the first to play all of their cards and score points. Each hand is filled with strategy and risk. Will you be the first player to play all of your cards? Perhaps you&#39;d like to make a little wager on that? Are you willing to risk 100 points? How about 200?  Tichu has long been the favorite card game of all time on BoardGameGeek. Find out why! I promise that you won&#39;t regret it!  Tichu boasts the following great features:      * Fully licensed and authorized by designer Urs Hostettler and publisher Fata Morgana Spiele.     * Computer controlled opponents boast a challenging and lifelike Artificial Intelligence that is configurable in numerous ways.     * Up to 4 humans can play linked over Bluetooth.     * Extensive tutorial and in-game documentation will teach you how to play and have you playing like a champ in no time.     * Shake-A-Hint&trade; feature helps you play while you learn.     * Track your statistics over multiple game sessions.     * Keep track of your game&#39;s progress with a fully automated score sheet.     * Play in English or German.     * Optimized high resolution images for iPhone 4 and iPad.
