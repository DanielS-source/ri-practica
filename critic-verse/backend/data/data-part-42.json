This addictive game will soon become a test of your peripheral vision, short-term memory and the key Ninja skill, your finger flicking speed.   The only question is &ndash; Do you have the Nunchaks to meet the challenge?  * Flick cards from the deck at targets, matching colors, symbols or both.   * Earn bonuses for beating the timer.   * Take care to hit targets and avoid causing chaos in the Dojo kitchen.   * Gather enough cards to progress to higher levels and earn a higher Ninja ranking.  * &#39;Good&rsquo; wildcards offer card bonuses while &#39;Evil&#39; wildcards can inflict extreme damage to your card count &ndash; learn their clues well and you may succeed.  ------  We are hearing about a bug related to Open Feint and access to the high scores screen.

The objective is to assemble the molecules shown using the atoms on the board. Sounds simple, huh? The part where this seemingly easy task gets more difficult, is that once an atom starts moving in one direction, it will continue moving until it hits another atom, or a wall.  Features:  - 60 Levels of varying difficulty - 20 Bonus Levels - Auto Save (if you stop in the middle of a game, you can pick right back up where you left off) - Sound Enable/Disable - Statistics - Undo - Pause - Board Reset (if you get stuck and want to start over)  Objective:  Reassemble the molecule shown in the example window (pay attention to the connectors between the atoms)  How to Play:  - Tap on an atom on the playing surface to select it. It will display the possible directions it can move using yellow arrows.  - Use the Directional arrows on the right of the screen (under the example window) to move an atom (only the valid direction will &#34;light up&#34;). - An atom can only move in one direction at a time. - Atoms will continue moving in the chosen direction until they hit another atom or a wall. - The next set of 6 levels (plus 2 bonus levels) are unlocked when all the previous levels (not including the bonus levels) are completed.  Tips: - You can undo your latest moves by clicking on the Undo button - You can reset the move count, board, and timer to their initial values by clicking on the Reset button - Pay attention to the connectors between atoms\", \"genre\": [\"Puzzle\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-05-12\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116733-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116733-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Mobile Novelties (Developer)\", \"Mobile Novelties (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Gun Runner Mafia\", \"title_search\": \"gun runner mafia\", \"title_keyword\": \"gun runner mafia\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/gun-runner-mafia/\", \"summary\": \"Gun Runner is a trading game, inspired by the trading games  on vintage platforms such as Dopewars.   The basic rules of trading apply. Buy low, sell high. What&#39;s cheap in one city may be expensive in another.   You&rsquo;ll need to fund your operations by borrowing money. But be careful, the cost of borrowing in this world can be very high so you&#39;ll need to know the cost of goods to keep ahead of those interest charges&hellip;  To make progress you&#39;ll need to aim high. Borrow as much as you can get but only when you know what you&rsquo;re going to buy and that you&#39;re getting a good price. The interest rates are non negotiable and the penalties are harsh.   And by the way the Interpol is after you.
