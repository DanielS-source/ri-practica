You begin your quest to create the most powerful crime family as a rookie on the streets of The City. To do this, you need to buy guns and cars to battle other Mafia Families (other real players around the globe!). To progress in the game, you need to beat other Mafia Families (while gaining experience and taking their cash) and perform other missions to gain respect and hone your skills.  As your power and wealth grows, more options become available to you. People will offer you properties to buy in The City; bankers will want to help you launder your cash; and other families will be both jealous and resentful of your success.  Join forces with your friends and add to each other&#39;s strength. You can persuade other Families in the game to join you...if they don&#39;t, you have an option to take them out.

Each mode of play is packed full of level content, increasing in difficulty, through 25 Platforming levels and 11 Time Trail levels. There is enough content for long, lasting game play.  **** CONTROLLABILITY ****  The car handling has been designed from the ground up for the accelerometer. The controls are easy, precise and fun. So much so that the player can hug the edge of a corner, using a jet assisted power-slide, and still feel perfectly in control. The car also features mid-air flight controls, allowing the player to nudge the angle of flight and adjust speed with air-braking. It feels very natural to play and we believe it to be the best driving experience on the iPhone to date.  **** CONNECTIVITY ****  Jet Car Stunts uses OpenFeint for community/leader board options.
