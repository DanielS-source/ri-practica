You must avoid the red dots for as long as possible.  The red dots gradually speed up making it ever more challenging.  Last as long as possible with 3 lives to get a high score.  * Filler Mode * In this mode you must fill up at least 70% of the screen with as large circles as possible while avoiding a number of red dots of an unknown entity. The game is made harder because the red dots are dynamic and bounces around all over the display. The control mechanism is highly unique: You touch the screen to begin, avoid the dots at all times, and the longer you keep pressing, the larger the void (circles) become, and the more points you score before letting go! Tilting the device will alter the direction of gravity, allowing the red dots to be trapped by circles or voids already created! If you get hit by a dot, a life is lost, and by completing 70% of the screen you progress to the next level. It&rsquo;s entertaining; it&rsquo;s simple, and its fun!   As you become better at the game and progress throughout the levels, additional red dots appear making the game increasingly difficult.   * Burst Mode * In burst mode the circles fade away after being created, and your focus is on achieving the maximum score with only 3 lives.  Additional features include high-score tables using Agon Online, and support for Twitter and Facebook.  More gameplay modes are coming in future updates!  ************************************************************ If your interested in trying out the game first then check out The Glowing Void Lite!

To get started, you'll line yourself up for a photo - positioning your head and hands as instructed so that your body can become your means to control the madness. You can choose from four game modes to play, each mode featuring five different challenges and hosted by different characters. Whichever mode you opt to play, the fact that it reflects the personality of your host is a guarantee that things will get crazy! In Wario's challenges, you'll have to make big movements with your face and body to succeed - perhaps collecting coins or shaking your head at high speed to dry off a dog! Mona\\u2019s mini-games, on the other hand, will require you to line yourself up with targets on the screen. You might have to move your head into place to catch a falling hat or squash a fly just by clapping your hands. In Jimmy\\u2019s challenges, you'll play peek-a-boo with a baby, stick fingers up nostrils and dish out a quick massage just by performing the right actions. The remaining set of mini-games are hosted by ninja twins, Kat and Ana. This duo know the value of good friends, which means all their challenges require you to have a sidekick handy. Line your faces up in a totem pole, smash through a stone block together and figure out the right formations to get through whatever comes your way.
