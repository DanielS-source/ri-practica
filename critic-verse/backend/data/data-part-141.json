Eat Lead pays homage to the games of yesteryear with a menagerie of classic enemies such as zombies, space marines, cowboys, genetically mutated super snipers, and more and an expansive level environment design that reflects videogame history in a next-gen package. The game fires on all cylinders with explosive artillery and combat moves to help gamers escape from a variety of predicaments including radically-changing environments during gameplay via hack effects Hazard's nemesis uses by altering the game\\u2019s code on the fly.

The game is entirely text-based--without graphics or sound effects--but powered by the vast, unstoppable power of your imagination.For example, suppose Lloyd has just informed you that your ship will crash land on the jungle moon of Cygnus Delta in 93 seconds. What will you do?A) Call upon your elite piloting skills to escape the moon&rsquo;s gravity well.B) Invite Lloyd to land the ship himself, if he&rsquo;s so smart.C) Make the prudent choice, and try landing on the moon&rsquo;s surface instead of attempting a risky escape.D) Spend the last 93 seconds of your life gleefully smashing Lloyd&rsquo;s screen with a torque wrench.Humanity needs you, Star Captain! Will you defeat the Blobs and come home as a war hero? Will you uncover the secret that sparked the Blob invasion? Will you serve as ambassador and convince the Blobs to spare the human race?
