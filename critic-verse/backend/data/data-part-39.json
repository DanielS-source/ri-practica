Even worse, the fabric of this reality is unstable and volatile, and their homecoming is incomplete.  Meanwhile, a foreign opponent reveals himself as an immaculate angel from Heaven, Gethsemane the Righteous One, whose sole purpose is to cast the people of Ecclesia back into the realm of nonexistence, punishment for the mistakes they cannot remember.  Despite the hopelessness of their situation, the survivors discover a ray of light: a demon from the past. This fearsome creature their ancestors long ago christened 'The Despair,' a name they spoke with dread and fright... is now the only hope left for Ecclesia.
