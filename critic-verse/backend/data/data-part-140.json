You can setup every possible Texas Hold&rsquo;em state by a few touches. After setting up the private and community cards and pressing the simulate button the app makes its magic during seconds. It reads every possible draw or combination an opponent might be on. For each draw or combination the app warns you in advance by displaying specific combination icons and its occurrence probability. Followed by about 3000 random tries in which the app checks winnings, draw endings and losses. There are always two simulation steps. The first is without drawing any additional community cards called P(win_0). The second step is with drawing additional community cards called P(win_1). During each simulation process the results that have been done so far are incrementally displaying. That means you wait less than a second and you receive automatically the first version of the probabilities you&rsquo;re waiting some time longer for. You&rsquo;re also able to see diagrams during a simulation running aside. After everything is done you get the final results as detailed statistics, diagrams and textual output with a full description of any simulation detail. With these textual simulation results you can send them to any other text based iPhone App or your email.   User Interface The graphical user interface is perfectly adapted for fast and precise use and further reuse. All relevant poker simulation settings like the flop cards remain stored for reusing with the same or an adapted setting. Any relevant information can be found and configured in easy iPhone like manner. If the home button is tapped on a running simulation it stops immediately. All the work that has been done until that event of cancelation is displayed in a proper way. If the device was shaken the hidden modus is activating. In that mode the game is seen from an inverted perspective. The app user gets random cards as privates and an opponent without defined cards these specific user cards. These cards aren&rsquo;t displayed. That function can be used to cheat against opponents or just to analyse the game from the different point of view. Each setting is well documented and specially designed for iPhone touch usage. After knowing how to use the UI the app is perfectly suited to play Poker, configure any detail and use the results for decisions in real time.   Indication Symbols There are symbols indicating possible draws and combinations of unknown opponent privates with the community cards given. After each simulation a dynamically generated dollar sign shows the probability to win by use of its changing background color.  Time to wait is time to decide On an iPhone 3GS the given introduction example (AKs with given flop / All-In / against 1 opponent / 3000 tries) had an overall duration of 2.270 seconds. The first result was given after 0.594s and it was enough precise for a real time decision.  Opponent Privates and Hand Ranges It&rsquo;s possible to specify hand ranges or known private cards for opponents within seconds. The hand ranges are working like barriers saying that the random generated privates have to be better/equal or worse/equal than the given. That makes them easy to understand and use.  Diagrams lead to Math understanding Have no fear of math! With this application you don&rsquo;t need to understand the probability theory or any other maths. That&rsquo;s because all results are interpreted and also shown as diagrams. These diagrams are showing exact ratios between success and failure. That&rsquo;s my way of getting you a better feeling of anything significant. The app auto detects all relevant combinations of any user defined state.\", \"genre\": [\"Gambling\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2011-03-16\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-189417-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-189417-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"rikeebytes (Developer)\", \"rikeebytes (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Galileo Mystery: The Crown of Midas\", \"title_search\": \"galileo mystery the crown of midas\", \"title_keyword\": \"galileo mystery the crown of midas\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/galileo-mystery-the-crown-of-midas/\", \"summary\": \"Discover The Secrets of a Museum with a Mysterious Past Stephan's new workplace is concealing more than it would first appear, and strange things are already starting to happen on the first night.

Bombermans land on App Store, as four heroes. They are Girl Ninja, Birdman, Frogman, and Uncle Zombie.You must be familiar with them:-)Bomberman is a strategic, maze-based computer and video game franchise. Today, Bomberman is featured in over 70 different games. Being commercially successful, with over 10 million units of games sold and more than 1 billion players.The games are set somewhere in a galaxy known as the Bomber Nebula, on Planet Bomber. Bomberman appears to be part of an intergalactic police force to help protect the galaxy, and now they are on App Store to challenge each other.Who will be the winner? It depends on you!GameplayThe general goal throughout the series is to complete the levels by strategically placing bombs in order to kill enemies and destroy obstacles. Exploding bombs can set off other bombs, kill or injure enemies and destroy obstacles. However, they can also kill or injure the player character, destroy powerups, and sometimes &quot;anger&quot; the exit, causing it to generate more enemies. Operations and Actions:    On iPad, we fully depend on touch screen to fulfill all required operations and actions, there are no ugly virtual keys. The actions are basically tap and swipe, and their combinations.    1) tap the grid where you are to put the bomb;    2) tap a reachable empty grid to move to that grid, grid by grid;    3) swipe to turn the direction, like swipe from left to right will turn your face to right, and move one grid if your right grid is empty.       Note, swipe depends on the direction, it doesn't require the position. You can swipe from any point to any point, and the character will turn the correct direction from the beginning position to the ending position.    4) combinations to push the bomb, after you have a glove, you can push the bomb(put by you, or by other characters).  The steps are:           a) tap yourself to put the bomb           b) tap a neighbouring empty grid to move to           c) swipe to the previous grid, the character will move back to the previous grid and the bomb is pushed, moving to the end of the way or collision with any bomb, or exploded grids.    Be careful on one illegal operation:    1) tap a non-empty grid, or an unreachable grid, this action will be ignored, and may cause you to stop at your half way.     We worked two months on the game and two weeks on the actions on touch screen. Hope you can love the game, and love the operations, they are really good if you can tap/swipe.
