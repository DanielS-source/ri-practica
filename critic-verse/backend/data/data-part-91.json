Description Starship is new Defence game which united the &ldquo;RTS&rdquo; and &ldquo;Shooting&rdquo; feature We invite you to come into starship&rsquo;s new wars.

Scenario The abundant Barukan planet was ruined by crashing into a minor planet in 2009 And few surviving Barukan people began to roam around the space.  In 2077, they finally found a blue planet, the Earth, a planet full of resources. They started invading the Earth for survival.  ?

User Review  &bull;Solid game but with some flaws by manlai - Version 1.1.0 - 2009. 11. 09  The Good: fun, easy to pick up and put down gameplay, and a nice twist on the standard tower defense but giving you weapons to directly attack invaders. The ability to repair and upgrade at the end of each level is also a great feature. Another appealing feature (to me anyway) is that you restart the level when you die instead of ending the game. Your progress is saved at the end of each level so picking up again to place is extremely easy.  &bull;Castle Defense without the mindless swiping by lvillalt - Version 1.1.0 - 2009. 11. 02  Not that I don&#39;t enjoy a castle defense game, but after awhile it does get a little repetitive to me. This game combines castle defense, with progressive upgrades for both hitpoints and defenses.  The gameplay is surprisingly deep, and you have to be smart about your choices, or you can dig yourself into too deep a hole.   ?

This classic game is now available for your enjoyment on the iPhone and iPod Touch.  Just like the old-school game you used to play but now blended with some new twists!  You&#39;ll enjoy it as much as you did back in the day and now you can pass along the fun you used to have to your kids.  They probably wouldn&#39;t be caught dead using the original hardware this ran on!  Your hero is Muncher.  You&#39;ll be directing his movements and eating habits while on your quest.  Your objective is to eat the correct numbers or equations based on the heading of the level you are on.  But be warned: there are creatures out there called Troggles that will get in your way!  You may remember some of those shady characters: Reggies, Helpers, Bashfuls, Workers, and Smarties.  Without the hardware of your Apple ][ handy, you now move around the grid by touching a box.  To eat the contents of a box, double touch it.  Since you are no longer restricted to moving one box at a time, you must learn how Muncher moves to be successful at avoiding Troggles!  For every correct answer you eat, you receive points.  Once you have eaten all of the correct answers you will move onto the next level.  You will lose one of your Munchers if an incorrect answer is eaten or you cross paths with a Troggle.  The game is over when you are out of lives.  You can briefly keep yourself safe from Troggles while inside of the roaming &#39;safe box&#39;.  After every three levels you can sit back and watch a short, classic movie of Muncher taking care of business.  When your game is over, you may be fortunate enough to have made it into the world-wide hall of fame!  There are five basic types of levels for you to play:        - Multiples: only eat multiples of the given number. - Factors: only eat factors of the given number. - Primes: only eat prime numbers. - Equality: only eat equations that are equal to the given number. - Inequality: only eat equations that are NOT equal to the given number.  You may also play all types together in series or in random order.  As you progress in each type the difficulty increases.  There are 100 distinct levels awaiting you!  A setting for level of difficulty is available to alter the number of extra Munchers you start with and how many Troggles will come after you.  The easier it is the fewer points you will receive per eaten correct answer.  Number Munchers is integrated with both CocosLive and OpenFeint!

Use special neutralizing agents to eliminate dangerous active agents in the reactor.  Get 4 or more of the same color in a row to eliminate the active agents. However, due to the instability of the reactor, random and dangerous surges are known insert undesired agents into the reactor (optional gameplay).  Clear them out before things get out of control!  For an extra challenge, turn on lead obstacles and see if your skills can handle it.For gameplay controls, players can touch and drag on screen to skillfully place agents in either left, right, or downward directions.

If they stack to the top then your game is over.  Smashing four or more blocks in one go will release one of three special power-ups &ndash; a time freeze, a stick of dynamite that blows up half the blocks on screen and a bomb that wipes out all the blocks.

Jetset&nbsp;is a game about air travel&nbsp;with a satirical twist. It is&nbsp;the first game of its kind, a mobile game for business travelers.&nbsp;  The challenges of today&#39;s airport security make business and pleasure travel increasingly difficult. Security is there to make you feel safe and get you to your plane in one piece. However, today&#39;s regulations change frequently and are often different from airport to airport.&nbsp;Now, you too can stand in the shoes of a security agent trying to avert terrorism while getting everyone through a checkpoint quickly. This is a game that&#39;s just as fun as waiting in line -- and one you can play in line as well.&nbsp;  Even better, when you play in one of the 100 world airports included in the game (from Albuquerque to Waco), you can win custom-made, collectable, digital&nbsp;souvenirs&nbsp;from each one.&nbsp;No longer will you be guilted into buying an overpriced gift for friends and family you leave behind, now you can gift items of sentimental value collected through your real travel plans.&nbsp;Or if you&#39;re more of the hoarding type, you can trade in your souvenirs for exclusive Jetset travel accessories.  Key Jetset features:  - Play 100 different airports from around the world and earn unique location-based&nbsp;souvenirs - Strip search travelers for fun - Confiscate dangerous travel items like pressurized cheese - Game automatically selects the airport you are in or near based on available location services* - Collect and play with souvenirs in your personal&nbsp;snowglobe, or share them with friends&nbsp;on Facebook* - Facebook gifts you give can be downloaded by your friends into the iPhone/iPod Touch Snowglobe App (sold separately) - Unlock silver, gold, and platinum souvenirs based on your performance -- just like your favorite airline loyalty program  - Are you a real jet setter? Redeem collections of souvenirs from different airports for exclusive Jetset travel trophies* - Highscore lists: local, global, and by airport  * Location, Facebook, and redemption features are subject to terms of service  **********  A number of players have complained, both in App Store reviews and in emails to us, that sometimes prohibitions can change just as the player is tapping the Proceed button.  This behavior is intentional. It was meant to highlight the arbitrary nature of current security policy.  That said, we acknowledge that some players might find this behavior frustrating. This update (v 1.2) of Jetset adds a program setting &#34;Unreasonable Fairness.&#34; When turned on, the game will delay rule changes if they are scheduled to occur too soon after the player taps Proceed to allow a passenger through.  To turn on Unreasonable Fairness, go to the main iPhone Settings app, scroll down to the Jetset section, and flip the toggle switch to ON.
