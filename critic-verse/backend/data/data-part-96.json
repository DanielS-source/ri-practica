You can not draw infinite number of lines; they are limited but you can buy more ones with your points. Instead of catching prizes falling from the popped bubbles, you buy them before starting the level. Bubbles are not quiet, they move down; you lose if they reach the bottom. You can control the ball speed when you launch it at starting the level. It seems a slow ball is better but it pops fewer bubbles per time unit. Balls are removed by groups of colors when ball hits them. And it brings several other amenities. the game is really challenging.
