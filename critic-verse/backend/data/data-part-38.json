Touchreviews? ...he whole game looks great with the just a position of the monsters and the butterflies being pulled off perfectly to create a musical game that will be loved by young and old a like.  AppSpy? Thumpies is a fresh breath of air in the rhythm genre, that should appeal to all ages.The game is in a league of is own. ________________________________________  ?Thumpies is a unique rhythm based music game for players of all ages. By correctly matching the beat of bouncing Thumpies, the player progresses through a song. If the player hits the targets in time, their Thump&rsquo;o&rsquo;meter slowly rises, but if the player misses or hits out of time, the meter falls. Unlike typical rhythm based games, Thumpies uses a mechanic of bouncing in time instead of just a series of notes. One way to describe Thumpies is a rhythm game crossed with juggling.  ?The quirky art design of Thumpies is accompanied by a unique musical score composed by award winning industry veteran David Kerr. The music was crafted with game play in mind giving the player a harmonizing experience. Players also have the chance to unlock progressively bizarre Thumpies by collecting different colored butterflies, that&rsquo;s if the hungry Thumpies don&rsquo;t eat them up on you first. Thumpies is a game that will keep people of all ages hooked with its addictive, quirky and stylistic gameplay.

I suspect the rest will be removed from my iPad&#34; - GrayerBeard  We are busy working on version 1.1 which will make it even better.  Big Bad Sudoku Book is a magical sudoku puzzle book that comes alive beneath your fingertips.  It was created exclusively for the Apple iPad to have the look and feel of a physical ancient sudoku book.  It&#39;s completely gesture based and offers a playing experience that you can only get on an iPad.  The game play mimics pencil and paper.  Answers or pencil marks can be entered quickly without &#39;switching input modes&#39; or using any &#39;buttons&#39;.  Big Bad Sudoku has some magical ways of helping you solve puzzles:  First are Highlights - a revolutionary way to see sudoku puzzles. With highlights you can softly highlight cells, rows, or columns with the gesture of a finger. They help focus your attention and narrow down possibilities. You can use highlights to temporarily mark positives or negatives.  - Swipe into a row to highlight the whole row, or swipe into a column to highlight the whole column.  - Press and hold on a number to highlight all occurrences of that number. - Press and hold again to highlight all rows, columns and blocks for all of those occurrences. - &#39;Draw&#39; on the board to highlight cells. - Tap off the board to clear all highlights.  Next are &#39;Marks&#39;. Sometimes known as pencil marks, candidates or possibles, these are small numbers or dots placed around the corners of the cells to help keep track of numbers that could fit there. To enter your own marks tape the small dots on the inside ring of the Pen. You can also Reveal the True Marks for the puzzle and they will actively update as you solve the puzzle. True marks and your own marks are two separate properties that you can show or hide at will.  Finally, if the puzzle is too hard to figure out, the &#39;Get Hint&#39; spell will give you a clue to help solve your puzzle. It might direct you to a cell and tell you your answer is incorrect. Or it might highlight an empty cell and tell you that a &#39;Single&#39; or a &#39;Hidden Single&#39; can be found there.  The Big Bad Sudoku Book is a virtual book full of millions of Sudoku puzzles and is perfect for casual gaming.
