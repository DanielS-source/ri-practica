Commonly known as Three Card Poker or Tricard Poker, 3 Card Pro combines the excitement of poker and the thrill of the casino in one game.  It is no surprise that it is quickly becoming one of the most popular casino games worldwide.  Adding 3 Card PRO to your growing collection PRO Series casino games will provide you the knowledge, strategy and training to become a poised player the next time you visit your favorite casino.  Sit at a Three Card Stud Poker table, and you will see three betting circles per player.  The top circle is for the pair-plus bonus bet, the middle for the ante, and the closest circle to the player is for the play or raise bet.  Using these circles, it is possible for a player, in essence, to play two poker games at once.  Three card stud poker does not use the same winning hierarchy as standard poker.  For example, it is more difficult to be dealt a straight with three cards than it is to be dealt a flush.  As you would expect from the PRO Series casino games, 3 Card PRO includes valuable training tools like our &#39;Ask the Dealer&#39; to determine your best odds to play the current hand.  Additionally, in depth stats are collected on your hands played so you can review your winning percentages and refine your winning strategies.  By playing 3 Card Pro, you can have hours of fun learning a new game if you have never played before, or you can hone your skills while playing one of your favorite casino games.

Little Antonio went down in history as the first and last gruesome death caused by running with scissors. For over 100 generations and in over 400 languages the phrase &#34;Don&#39;t run with scissors&#34; has completely dominated the landscape and eliminated the once pure joy of the sport.

The soul of the Angel once belonged to a very beautiful girl who refused to become the Warlock&#39;s lover and to help him in his evil deeds, so the dark sorcerer has stolen her soul for that. No one dared to help the lonely soul, but the time passed and she turned into a Good Angel. The Angel decided to take the sweethearts&#39; side and to reunite their lives.
