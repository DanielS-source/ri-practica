The game has the same look and feel established in Phantom Hourglass. Link has a valuable new companion. While navigating dungeons, he's accompanied by a Phantom, a hulking suit of armor that responds to his commands. Players can tap the Phantom to take command of him, then draw a line on the touch screen to direct him where to go. The stout Phantom can walk through fire or lava, be used as a platform to carry Link above dangers, or even run interference to block Link from harm. When Link conducts the train, players enjoy a satisfying combination of action and real-time puzzle solving as they determine which track to take and how to best manipulate their speed. When on the train, Link must plot the best route to the end of the line around ever-moving obstacles. While en route, Link might need to fire an onboard cannon at enemies who attack the train or sound the whistle to scare animals off the tracks. Link uses a variety of new items and weapons, including the Whirlwind, which players activate by blowing into the microphone of the Nintendo DS system. As with The Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, players can draw notes on the in-game maps using the stylus on the touch screen.

From the Victorian world of the Dusktreaders MMO, explore the fast paced city of New Hexborough armed with silver bullets, blasts of flame, and your backup blade where moaning zombies, cackling skeletons, and howling werewolves lurk around every corner.  You will see continued free updates to Dusktreaders including more missions and other additional improvements.  We appreciate your business. ________________________________________  CRITICAL: When you download any new application PLEASE RESTART your iPhone/iTouch for best performance.    NOTE: sound effects and music are muted if you have your iPhone on vibrate. ________________________________________  Directions:   Using the settings menu, you can chose between tilt and touch movement.  WITH TILT MOVEMENT: tilt your device toward you to go backward, away from you to go forward, and side to side to turn.  WITH TOUCH MOVEMENT: place and hold your thumb on the arrows in the left corner and drag to move and turn.  There are four buttons for game play.  The upper left button allows you to switch between your gun, flamethrower, and your sword.  The upper right button allows you to pause.  The middle right button jumps and the lower right button fires your gun, activates a burst from your flamethrower, or swings your sword.  To turn on or off music and sound effects on your iPhone, switch the device to vibrate using the physical switch by the volume rocker.  For iTouch users, turn the volume down with the rocker.  The sword hits all monsters that are near by, the gun hits only the monster directly ahead of you, and the flamethrower hits monsters who are close and in front of you for damage over time.  Watch how much ammo you have left (the silver bar) when using the gun.  You will switch to the flamethrower automatically if you run out while using the gun.  You can find additional ammo in boxes on the ground and you can also find health elixirs on the ground to heal up those wounds.  Each mission unlocks the next.  Once you have completed them all, the difficulty of missions are increased.   ________________________________________  1.1.2 release notes:  -Created settings menu to change controls. -The attack button will auto-repeat if you hold it down. -Added option to steer using touch controls instead of tilt controls. -For new games, you can set the difficulty to easy, hard, or unfair. -Updated storyline. -Added death animations. -Replaced old Ruins mission. -Increased the size of the Downtown mission. -Removed timer. -Updated art for winning and losing screens. -Dead monsters now respawn after time. -Fixed issues.\", \"genre\": [\"MMORPG\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-01-23\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-111501-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-111501-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Granite Games (Developer)\", \"Granite Games (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Cogs\", \"title_search\": \"cogs\", \"title_keyword\": \"cogs\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/cogs/\", \"summary\": \"Cogs is a puzzle game where players build machines from sliding tiles.

In addition, players now move, behave and position themselves more realistically. On attack, players analyze space more effectively, curve their runs in an attempt to stay onside, create passing lanes naturally, and drive for more variety in attacking options. On defense, new concepts like position priority enable defenders to multitask so dangerous spaces left open by teammates out of position are covered. Plus, slide tackle targeting, press marking, and better-urgency clearance logic provide new options that make defending a tactical skill in FIFA Soccer 10. In goal, a myriad of improvements and refinements to goalkeeper intelligence result in a more responsive and powerful rushing system and ultra-realistic saves. Better balance on lofted through balls, improved goalkeeper intelligence, more realistic shooting mechanics with less shots hitting the goal posts, a practice arena to perfect skills, and a more immersive soccer experience through continuous play and quick free kicks are just a few of the issues raised by fans and addressed in FIFA Soccer 10. Three new innovations revealed today at E3 have been developed to change the player control experience in FIFA Soccer 10. The first-ever true 360 degree dribbling system gives players finer control of the ball, enabling them to find spaces between defenders that previously were not possible. Using an all-new animation technology, skilled dribblers now have the ability to face the defender and use highly responsive lateral dribbling to skip past him. An innovative concept called Freedom in Physical Play enables players to perform wider dribble touches and new collision sharing creates a varied, less predictable, and extended fight for possession between the dribbler and a defender.\\r FIFA Soccer 10 also features a deeper iteration of the ever-popular Manager Mode with more than 50 major improvements, including new match realism, realistic player transfers based on multiple decision points, and true-to-life player growth curves.
