I think TipCat Games clinched Cell War with this; both casual and hardcore players will be satisfied with what the game has to offer.            On the easy level, there were noticeably less enemies, they fired slower, and there was never more than one semi-boss or boss on the screen at one time. On the hard difficulty, the screen began to become swarmed with easily killed but annoying enemies, and sometimes there was even more than one semi-boss on screen. In addition, there are quite a few levels and numerous bosses. No matter what the player&rsquo;s skill level is at, Cell War has something to offer to each and every person and will satisfy their need for a quality shooter.&#34; nodpad.com  ******************************  FULL VERSION:  ******************************  Cell War is a horizontal-scrolling shoot&#39;em up arcade game.  Driving the nano machine, your mission is to fight fearful viruses and save human from disease! Diving into the microworld. Be ready for the challenges you never met before.  Tilt to move and fire. Touch enemies to fire missiles. Generate shockwave to chain kill enemies and shield yourself from bullets. Fight against huge viruses.

The Carrier is crucial for getting ground based CELs over gaps.  Every CEL has the ability to move in any direction while simultaneously shooting in another. Your CEL also has the ability to seamlessly change to a circle strafing mode, giving you a greater advantage while in combat. When a CEL is destroyed, a number of special upgrades called \\u201cphyta crystals\\u201d are generated.  Nearby CELs can collect these to gain shields, health, firepower, and other temporary abilities \\u2013 15 in total.  They can be used to obtain one of 19 unique secondary weapons as well.  When enough white phyta crystals are collected, upgraded versions of the CEL are attainable that will give you a tactical advantage and new permanent upgrades. Be careful, your enemies can collect phyta crystals as well. CellZenith features a campaign mode where you will engage in 30 different story-driven levels to seek out and defeat the unknown force and escape back to Earth. Also included are 14 Instant action maps and four highly addictive minigames [Cel Attack, Tournament, Ball Escape, Black Hole].

This is the most polished and optimized version of X-Plane for iPhone yet, with a LOT of testing done on the AI and multiplayer modes!  Of course, as we always do with these types of features, we have also made multiplayer a FREE upgrade to ALL the X-Plane flavors... but we think it is the most FUN in RACING, where you can race through courses against your friends and compare times at the end!!!  So here is how it works: X-Plane RACING comes with 4 regions (for now.. of course we will add more in free upgrades, same as always) and 4 planes (for now.. of course we will add more in free upgrades, same as always) with a race course for each plane in each region... a total of 16 race-courses. These course are presented as &#39;highway-in-the-sky&#39; &#39;hoops&#39; that you fly though, racing against the clock, right alongside the AI plane. X-Plane RACING will show you the time through the course, and number of hoops missed, at the end of the race. Can you fly faster than the AI plane? Some courses race down river-valleys.. others through mountain ranges, other through clouds. Some through snow-covered rocky mountains, others through desert. My favorite is the F-15 course in Anchorage, Alaska... can you handle it? To our knowledge, this is the most realistic flight physics for any aerial racing sim ever done. Pulling these peppy WW-2 fighters, or massive jets, through the hoops in the Mach 0.5 to Mach 1.25 range at low altitude through mountains and canyons is... special.  Then, once you get the hang of racing against the computer, it is time for MULTIPLAYER: Race against your friends! Who can get through the courses fastest? Both of your times are tracked and posted. This works on both iPhone AND iPodTouch... you just need to be on the same wireless network for the phones to see each other.  Racing, you can choose from the:  F-4-U Corsair: A tricky hi-speed fighter of World-War-2. Being a tail-dragger landing gear configuration, it will be VERY tricky to land. You must land in a full-stall, nose-high attitude. (BE SURE TO HOLD FULL-AFT STICK ON THE TAKEOFF ROLL IN THIS PLANE TO HOLD THE TAILWHEEL DOWN FOR STEERING AUTHORITY).  P-51 Mustang: The premier fighter of World-War-2 .Being a tail-dragger landing gear configuration, it will be VERY tricky to land. You must land in a full-stall, nose-high attitude. (BE SURE TO HOLD FULL-AFT STICK ON THE TAKEOFF ROLL IN THIS PLANE TO HOLD THE TAILWHEEL DOWN FOR STEERING AUTHORITY).  F-4 Phantom: The King of the &#39;Jet-Age&#39;, this plane is amazing to take through the desert canyons at Mach 1.25.  F-15 Eagle: This powerful machine is the pinnacle of pilot-friendly jet-power... IF you can handle Mach 1.25 between the mountain peaks of Alaska... can you?  We also have some new tweaks in here like tire-skidding sound that is accurately hooked up the street-racing-accurate tire-physics model, visible afterburners, and a basic autopilot... all cool stuff that is also in the FREE 9.08 upgrade to ALL the X-Plane flavors, same as always!\", \"genre\": [\"Sports\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-02-23\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116111-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116111-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Laminar Research (Publisher)\", \"Laminar Research (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Virtual Chick\", \"title_search\": \"virtual chick\", \"title_keyword\": \"virtual chick\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/virtual-chick/\", \"summary\": \"This adorable ball of yellow fur wants to come home to you!

The aim is to move your frog from one end of the screen to the other, to eat a delicious fly. You can only move one leg at a time, and only one foot can rest on a particular spot at a time.  There&#39;s no time limit. You can take your time considering your next move and watching the gentle interplay of light and shadow.  There&#39;s no move limit. However circuitous a route you take, eating the fly unlocks the puzzle. You can return to any puzzle at any time for another go, if you want to beat your own score.  You can skip any puzzle at any time from the daisy menu. If you&#39;re having trouble with a level, just move on to the next one, and come back to it later.  Each puzzle has a par, representing the shortest number of moves required to complete the puzzle. Achieving that perfect solution will sometimes require fiendishly twisted thinking!  ----------------------------------------  - 100 unique levels - 6 species of frog - Hours of replayability - A host of beautiful environments - Soothing soundscape - Lovely lighting  ----------------------------------------  o Touch the daisy for in-game options o Visit the website for hints and tips  ----------------------------------------\", \"genre\": [\"Puzzle\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-06-25\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116700-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116700-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Ancient Workshop (Developer)\", \"Ancient Workshop (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Atoms (2009)\", \"title_search\": \"atoms 2009\", \"title_keyword\": \"atoms 2009\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/atoms-2009/\", \"summary\": \"Atoms is an addictive, simple  agility-based game.

This game is fast-paced, easy to learn, and solves in minutes. Being clueless has its advantages.  OBJECTIVE: Insert letters in the white circles so words form horizontally and vertically that match the puzzle&#39;s solution.   The player moves a cursor from circle to circle by pressing the arrow buttons. A push of a letter button will insert that letter in the circle at the cursor.  Only one of the selectable letters at any circle match the puzzle&rsquo;s solution.  AUTO-CHECK:  Every 30 seconds any incorrect letters entered change to red, and any correct letters change to blue. Also during an auto-check, a new score is computed based on the number of correct letters entered so far, elapsed time, and level of play.   IMPORTANT: Red letters must be changed to solve puzzle. Player can make changes at any time.  HIGH-SCORE HINTS:   1) Stick and Move   2) Jump   3) Converge  1) Stick and Move.  Don&rsquo;t remain idle at any circle more than a few seconds. If the correct selection is not obvious, just enter a guess and move to another circle. Every 30 seconds, the auto-check awards points for correct guesses, changes letter colors to reflect correctness, but provides no added info for empty circles. There is no scoring penalty for incorrect guesses. Player can change guesses at any time.  2) Jump.  Use the jump button (double arrow) almost exclusively when moving the cursor.  The jump button skips cursor over blue letters (ie. letters confirmed correct by auto-check). The direction of the jump button matches the last press of either the right or left arrow button.  3) Converge. Whenever guessing is necessary, use a consistent process of elimination so as not to repeat incorrect choices (eg. guess in some easy-to-remember order, such as alphabetical order).  No more than 3 guesses are needed to pinpoint the correct letter at any circle.  All puzzles can be solved within 3 traversals of the puzzle grid.
