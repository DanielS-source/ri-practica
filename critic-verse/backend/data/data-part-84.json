Each experiment chipped away at Gordo&rsquo;s friendly demeanor, leaving him hardened and bitter. In a high-risk experiment to test a new type of rocket booster, Gordo was blasted into space.  The rocket misfired and crashed on a nearby planet where both the experiment and Gordo were abandoned and soon forgotten.   Gordo&rsquo;s despair and anger became all encompassing and the beauty and happiness of the world around him only fueled his rage. Using everything he learned as a science experiment, he built an army of robots with the goal of making the rest of the world as miserable as he was.   Gordo now travels the galaxy, rounding up those most joyous and happy, trapping them in cages and leaving them behind, guarded by his robot minions. But one happy little boy has escaped Gordo&rsquo;s grasp. Armed with a rocket and fueled by fun, the little RocketBoy is building an elite force called the Cannon Cadets.  You must help RocketBoy free his friends so they can restore fun to the Galaxy and show Gordo how to have fun again!   **FEATURES** -80 beautifully illustrated levels -4 playable characters (RocketBoy, RocketGirl, Pop, and Granati) -Hidden Bonus Levels -Amazing game physics including hinged and moving objects, and complex levels that would delight even Rube Goldberg and Heath Robinson  For more, follow us @XMGStudio on Twitter!

Airbase Defender is an old-school action game with an 80s flair.  The objective of the game is to prevent enemy paratroopers from conquering your base and blowing up the player-controlled FLAK cannon.  Three types of weapons can be used for defence. The first is the FLAK cannon, which can shoot down falling paratroopers before they reach the ground. For shooting down five paratroopers, the player is rewarded with a smart missile which can shoot down helicopters.  A very special weapon is the so-called &#34;shake&#34;. As soon as the player has shot down five helicopters, shaking the iPhone releases an atomic shockwave that destroys all visible enemies at once. Only the few paratroopers that have taken shelter under the player&#39;s FLAK cannon are spared this gruesome fate. The &#34;shake&#34; is accompanied by a vibration signal from the iPhone.  The cannon is controlled either by accelerometer or using a slider (so-called Classic Mode). The missiles are fired by tapping the screen at their desired destination.  The game graphics are lovingly designed with great attention to detail in a 2D pixel style that is deliberately reminiscent of the arcade games of the 80s.  The action-packed gameplay is accompanied by Heavy-Metal music. The menu features an orchestral soundtrack, setting the mood before the player faces the challenge ahead.  Furthermore, the game supports Openfeint - a system which allows players to compare their high scores with each other worldwide.  For everyone who loves classic action games in the style of Sabotage, there is no alternative to Airbase Defender.  Features overview: - 2D pixel-style graphics and animation - 3 weapon types (FLAK, missiles, shake) - 2 control types (Classic and accelerometer) - Orchestral soundtrack + Heavy Metal in-game music - Openfeint support - Tested on OS4 - Multitasking support\", \"genre\": [\"Defense\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-10-05\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-171249-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-171249-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"CF Trading GmbH (Publisher)\", \"CF Trading GmbH (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Balloon Popper\", \"title_search\": \"balloon popper\", \"title_keyword\": \"balloon popper\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/balloon-popper/\", \"summary\": \"How many balloons can you pop?
