Its free now !   (C) 1986-2009, Rolf-Dieter Klein, Martin Ulrich, Munich, Bremen, Germany  Ports of Call has a long tradition  the first version was released on the Amiga 1986 with other versions following.  Now the classic game is getting mobil. We kept the classic interface and design by intention, as this was a user request since years - an update for full screen support will follow soon, also other versions are on our wish and todo list.  A Background on Tramp Shipping:  The traffic of goods by sea is organized  in accordance with international agreements and contracts between individual countries.  About 80% of the goods (called &#34;cargo volume&#34;) transported between two countries is handled by ships registered under the flags of the countries concerned. The remaining 20% are  open to the free competition of ships under other flags. These ships, called &#34;tramp&#34; ships, are usually prepared to transport all kinds of goods. This aspect of the shipping business is the focus of Ports of Call.  The Object of the Game  Each player founds his own shipping  company, with a starting capital of $4.6 million to buy ships. Freight and ports of call can be chosen continuously from offers on the market. Then the captain chooses an economic travelling speed and casts off to encounter many adventures on the high seas.  After unloading his cargo, the captain  is credited with the agreed payment. Then he may refuel, make necessary repairs, and so on. The next job is to find a new, lucrative cargo, buy further ships, and/or repay his mortgages; in other words, he must have a more productive company than his competitors.  A player&#39;s chances of success improve  the more he knows about international  shipping. All data for the game originated from actual developments in the maritime world: the fluctuation of freight rates, refueling costs, port charges, and ship operating costs.  But the game is not a pure economic game,  also a ship simulator is integrated, and the captain can steer his ship manually, either if necessary, or to save money and get a good status.  In summary, Ports of Call has been developed with this motto in mind:  &#34;Software with Hard Facts.&#34;  The LITE version is restricted to 1/2 hour of game time. Please support us by buying the full version.  latest hints: start using preowned ships, and keep them in good condition to avoid disasters (like rats for example).

Smaller ones are being found at a rate of a dozen a day. So when a huge new asteroid appears the only surprise is that it was overlooked for so long. It is duly assigned the next available name, Rama, and is promptly forgotten about--but not for long.\\r As Rama approaches Earth, every question about it seems to have an answer that raises more questions. And as observations continue, the most impossible explanation becomes the only one: Rama is actually a spaceship.\\r The next step is obvious: mankind must attempt a rendezvous. But only one of our spaceships is close enough. As fate has it. that ship is the Endeavor--the ship that you command.\\r Without even reading them, you know what your orders will be: to rendezvous with the giant ship, to explore it, to meet with its inhabitants, and to return home before it speeds on its orbit away from the solar system.\\r Yet even in your excitement, you realize it is not an easy mission. You will have to make difficult decisions--many of them. And you will have to work very fast--because if you stay on Rama too long, returning home will be impossible.\\r From the first moment it has been clear: this is the mission of your lifetime. Thousands would gladly sacrifice anything for the chance to be in your shoes. But only you have that chance. Only you can explore Rama.\\r Rendezvous with Rama is the first computer adventure game to be produced in collaboration with Arthur C. Clarke. The program allows you to talk with three other crew members, and comes complete with detailed maps of Rama and the Endeavor. Multiple disks offer extended play--and the game may be played with or without graphics.\\r ARTHUR C. CLARKE, world-famous author of 2001: A Space Odyssey, continues to be a major force in science fiction; over twenty million copies of his books have been printed world-wide. The novel Rendezvous With Rama has won the three highest science fiction awards: the Hugo, the Nebula, and the John W.

You must use the ninja skills of quick reaction, dexterity, strategy, and love of KILLING to survive the never-ending onslaught.  Dead them before they dead you.  Aim using your device&#39;s accelerometer and shoot by tapping the screen.  As in real life, some enemies will require more than one shot, so pay attention to the blood!

Thankfully there&#39;s a Ninja Store, but it ain&#39;t cheap.  You&#39;ll get cash based on the # of points earned per level.  Increase your points with overall accuracy and with the consecutive-shot multiplier.  After clearing a level, you will be given an opportunity to play a mini-game to earn even more cash.  Then, go shopping.  Buy killer weapons like the Ninja-Q (fire arrows), the Triple Death (3 darts fire at once), or Da Bomb (Da Bomb!).  Each level becomes more difficult, so use your weapons well and spend your money wisely...and don&#39;t get shot!  Your Ninja has 8 hearts and you&#39;ll lose one each time you get hit.  You can buy more hearts, but trust me, real Ninjas prefer to spend money on weapons that kill their enemies in painful, deathy and utterly entertaining ways!  MINIGAMES:   Obstacle - Bow &amp; arrow game...aim, pull, shoot!  Big bucks for head shots!  Balance - Stay on the bamboo pole, lean into the target zone and let the cash keep on cha-chinging (that means &#34;adding up&#34; in old timey cash register speak)!  Memory - With bow staff in hand, smack the punching bag in the correct sequence or die a shockingly painful death!  ...all mini-games can be played in stand-alone mode, providing multiple lives and levels!

One that blends digital interactivity with real world interaction. We call it a scvngr and we hope you like it!  What is a Scvngr?: A scvngr is a high-tech way to have adventures, explore your surroundings and discover awesome places hidden right around you and all over the world from any mobile phone. Think of it like a high-tech scavenger hunt where clues, riddles, missions and challenges are delivered right to your phone. However, it goes far beyond just that. Scvngrs can be interactive tours, high-tech adventures, neat ways to explore a city or neighborhood, an immersive and engaging guide through a museum or cultural institution and so much more.  Who builds scvngrs? Anyone and everyone can build a scvngr! Some are built professionally by the SCVNGR Team. Some are built by institutions, museums, city halls, visitor bureaus, cultural centers and more who use the SCVNGR platform to attract, education, engage and entertain visitors in a whole new way. Some scvngrs are built by community members just like you (totally for free!) at www.scvngr.com/xplr. (Note: There&rsquo;s a feature for rating individual scvngrs at www.scvngr.com/xplr. Please rate the app separately from the individual games.)  What types of scvngrs exist? Because scvngrs are built by institutions and individuals, professionals and amateurs, cities, museums, cultural sites and just regular people like you and me, all sorts of different scvngrs exist for just about anything you can imagine! Scvngrs range from interactive city tours, to high-tech scavenger hunts, to engaging and innovative guides through museums and cultural sites to one-time events that have you running around your town, city, neighborhood or school solving clues and challenges, collecting items or taking pictures all to score points and take the top slot on the leader-board or just have fun! Scvngrs can be competitive or just for fun. Some scvngrs are set in certain locations and must be played there because they transform the world around you into your very-own virtual game-board. Other scvngrs can be played from anywhere as they turn whatever&rsquo;s around you into an exciting and entertaining alternate reality! Scvngrs can be played individually or you can sync up your phone with your friends and family to all play on one team. To learn more about all the great scvngrs out there, check out www.scvngr.com/xplr.  What phones can play? Any phone can play! Scvngrs can be played via text message, mobile web and of course our native phone applications.

Luckily, by being here you&rsquo;ve got a great phone, so enjoy all the advanced features! (Please note that for iPod Touch, a wifi connection is necessary.)  Where can I learn more?
