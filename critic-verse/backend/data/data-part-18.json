Characters can be approached but offer different responses and be found in different places, while new clues and gameplay paths can be followed. The title follows Harry Mason, as he attempts to unravel the mystery of his missing daughter, Cheryl. A broken man, Mason\\u2019s investigations lead him to the mist-shrouded, snowy streets of Silent Hill: a malevolent town where the shadows play host to a wealth of evil, misshapen creatures. Designed to make full use of the Wii's unique controllers, Silent Hill: Shattered Memories uses the Wii Remote as a torch and cell phone as Mason looks for clues. The torch is vital for scouring the darkened, abandoned buildings of Silent Hill, while the phone acts as a secondary user interface, allowing the player to access maps via its GPS capabilities and take pictures of interesting elements. Likewise, the Wii Remote also can be used to pick up, examine and manipulate items to solve puzzles along the journey. Such technology was not available when the original Silent Hill was released in 1999, and its inclusion showcases Konami\\u2019s determination to enhance the playing experience with new, available technology. Also new to Shattered Memories is a psyche profile element, which monitors every aspect of player\\u2019s reactions - from where they explore first, items that have been examined, and their reaction to those they meet. Small visual elements will also be altered slightly, adding to the oppressing atmosphere where nothing is what it seems. The psyche profile will adapt Harry\\u2019s actions as and when he meets normal-looking people or the game's many inhuman denizens.

Your game play is over when you loose all the beans to play with.  Points differ according to which plate the beans lands; aim for the red, for it is the highest!  Earn bonus points through performance&mdash; finishing fast would earn you Time Bonus, and finishing without mistake would earn you &ldquo;Perfect Bonus.&rdquo;  Reaching a certain point would enable you to increase the number of beans&mdash;more beans, more advantage.   ***Game Feature***  Several types of realistically-designed beans and beautiful oriental plates to which the beans are aimed at  Each bean has its characteristics (big, small, light, heavy etc) which would affect the way they flip.

It is a simple yet challenging game. Variations of Lunar Landing have been implemented on many different platforms.  Lunar Landing adds a couple of (hopefully welcome!) new features to the classic Apple sample application:  Over 20 background screens of actual moon photos! Background screens change with each new level and each new game.  Interactive Help screen describes and demonstrates how to hold iPhone during game play and how to activate the various thrusters.   Practice Mode with crashing disabled. The ship will land when the speed, position and tilt are correct, but will bounce if any of the three parameters are out of acceptable limits. Also, the fuel does not run out in practice mode. This allows users to get a feel for landing the ship without having to start a new game from scratch after each failed landing attempt. Be aware, no high scores are recorded when in practice mode!  Paddle Play mode. Tilting the iPhone moves the landing pad instead of moving the lander. The main thruster is still controlled as before, but moving the landing pad instead of tilting the ship makes the ship MUCH easier to land. This option may be used alone or in combination with practice mode. It is easier to learn to land the ship by using the Paddle Play option.  Multiple Level Scoring allows you to land the ship multiple times for a higher score. The high score is entered after finally crashing when at least one level has been completed. The levels completed and the interim score are displayed after each successful landing.  The goal of Lunar Landing is to land your space ship on the small landing pad at the bottom of the screen before your fuel is depleted. In order to safely land, the ship must settle on the landing pad within an acceptable position range, without tilting too far to either side, and without dropping too quickly. The landing pad duplicates the three status lights across the top of the screen for Velocity, Angle, and Position.  Each level is scored on its own. The levels are scored according to:  Up to 4000 points for the slowest vertical velocity that you can land at.  Up to 2500 points for the percentage of fuel you have left after landing.  Up to 2000 points for the least amount that you are rotated when you land. Selecting the Paddle Play option will cancel out these points.  Up to 1500 points according to how closely you can center the ship on the landing pad.  Maximum score for each level is 10,000 points (8000 points with the Paddle Play option selected). However, it is not possible to get the maximum score due to needing some amount of fuel to slow the ship down enough to safely land ...  High scores are displayed after completing play (by crashing) when at least one level has been successfully landed. A mode indicator of &#34;P&#34; is displayed on scores achieved with the Paddle Play option set.\", \"genre\": [\"Space Sim\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-04-06\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-119826-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-119826-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Croesus-Mode.com (Developer)\", \"Croesus-Mode.com (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"MotionX Poker\", \"title_search\": \"motionx poker\", \"title_keyword\": \"motionx poker\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/motionx-poker/\", \"summary\": \"Featured in Apple&rsquo;s TV commercial!  ?

Here is how it works: In X-Plane 9.61 Beta-1 or later for desktop, go to the SETTINGS menu, INTERNET screen. From there, enter the IP address of your iPad or iPads (up to 4 for now). Each of those iPads, if running EFIS-App for iPad, can then show different instruments. Then, you will have X-Plane for  desktop running the flight model and visuals, and a small handful of iPads running as instrument panels! This makes it possible for you to make your own flight-simming cockpits at home! For the next step, build your own cockpit out of wood or fiberglass with a projector screen in front, and have X-Plane for desktop running the overhead projector to project the out-the-window visuals image onto the screen. Use CH-Products or Saitek joysticks for flight control, and a small handful of iPads with this app for the instrument panel! You can then very easily have a really amazing home-built sim. Right now, you get a few EFIS&#39;s and a few standby gages... we will add more instruments over time to this app so you can build ever-more-complex and complete panels with nothing but iPads hooked to a master copy of X-Plane! Now get a few iPads, a projector or some big flat-screen, some carpentry hardware, and get cracking on building your own flight-sim cockpit! We have made it easy!  Then, to try something REALLY cool, select the Evo-Controller avionics. This is an avionics display that has an artificially-intelligent auto-land system! Here is how it works: At any time, you hit the &#39;Autoland: Servos&#39; button, and the plane will run simulated glides down to every airport within gliding range of the airplane. It will score the outcome of each glide, pick the one that is most likely to have a safe landing, and then steer the plane down that path for landing! This is an artificially-intelligent auto-land system... quite a fascinating piece of AI to experiment with!
