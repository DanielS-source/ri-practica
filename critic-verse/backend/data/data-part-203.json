Anyone can pick up the Wii Zapper and become a master marksman in the quick-play shooting galleries of Link's Crossbow Training. Dozens of fast-paced stages offer a wide variety of game play, from shooting stationary targets to defending a supply wagon from onrushing hordes of enemies. Multiplayer modes let players and their friends share a Wii Zapper to shoot for the high score. Link's Crossbow Training comes bundled with the Wii Zapper. The Wii Zapper requires the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, housing both in a comfortable and intuitive frame. The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while simply aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. Pulling the trigger fires Link's crossbow. By aiming off screen, players can turn Link to face in a new direction (again, on stages that allow this). Link's Crossbow Training contains three basic game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger. There are 27 stages in total, and these categories represent only generally how each individual stage operates. Each stage's goal is to earn the highest score possible within the time limit. All rounds can be played with multiple players: Players pass the Wii Zapper around and then play one at a time and compete for the high score.

There are four power-ups; STARS will increase the amount of balloons to pop (Means More Points!), BOMBS will wipe out every balloon but give you half the points for each balloon (Hit A Bomb After A Star To Get A Big Jump In Points!), TIME-CLOCK adds 10 seconds to your game (More Game Time Means More Points!), and SKULLS generates black balloons.

On easy levels, the player can have a limited number of accidents and still be able to proceed to the next level. However, on difficult levels, no accidents are allowed.  The cars can not be stopped for too long or else they will get impatient and drive off. This will usually get the players heart beat racing. Only nerves of steel will prevent crash carnage.This variety in game play creates an ideal game for both beginners and experienced players alike. For players that want a challenge, the hard levels are for you, while for players that simply want a relaxing experience, try the easy or medium levels. The player also has the choice of submitting a game high score or viewing other player high scores. No internet access is required to play the game and is only required for submitting high scores.
