You won&rsquo;t find another game that looks, plays, or sounds like 100 Rogues, as it&#39;s got fully animated 2D pixel art, and classic videogame-style music.  100 Rogues is about player improvement more than character improvement, as your unfortunate Rogue&rsquo;s death is almost guaranteed for most players. Like a game of Tetris or Galaga, 100 Rogues isn&rsquo;t about completion; it&rsquo;s about seeing how you can do in one play session.  Explore randomly-generated dungeons; find rare magical weapons, armor and other artifacts; meet strange, interesting monsters and do battle in a thought-provoking, turn-based-strategy combat system.  Our characters have their own unique skill trees, and as you gain experience you can unlock new skills to survive against tougher opponents.
