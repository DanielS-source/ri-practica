You are given a randomly-generated target waveform composed of 4 subcomponent waveforms.  Your goal is to reproduce that waveform as closely as possible by adjusting 4 subcomponent waveforms of your own.  The target waveform is red. Your current cumulative waveform generated by the sum of your 4 component waveforms is green, and each of your component waveforms is blue.  Basically, you must adjust each of your blue waveforms until your green waveform matches the red waveform.  The &#34;New&#34; button will generate a new random target waveform.  The &#34;Next Frequency&#34; button cycles through each of your subcomponent waveforms, circularly. (The current frequency is always displayed on the bottom right of the screen in blue).  And, the Mode button switches between Beginner and Advanced modes.  In Beginner mode, there is no phase-difference between the 4 waveforms, so you only have to worry about the amplitude (up and down) adjustment.  In Advanced mode, you have to adjust amplitude and phase (right and left).  It is VERY difficult, because you are adjusting 8 parameters in order to achieve one target result.  I hope you find it challenging and informative.  Also, the bottom left of the screen indicates the RMS (Root Mean Square) value of the difference between your green waveform and the red target waveform.  Try to get this value down to zero.  A wealth of information is available online (e.g. Wikipedia), and you may find that the Fourier Transform is not only a mathematical construct, but it is used in: music, electrical engineering, physics, image processing, robotics, etc.  It allows you to view the world in a whole new domain.\", \"genre\": [\"Edutainment\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-05-21\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-154694-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-154694-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Golf Mania 3D\", \"title_search\": \"golf mania 3d\", \"title_keyword\": \"golf mania 3d\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/golf-mania-3d/\", \"summary\": \"Golf Mania 3D is an action-packed golf game situated at an unusual driving range.

Aurifi works with all standard installations of 3.1.3, and will not work with *non-standard* installs. Thanks!  A NEW FORM OF PLAY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION  Aurifi is a ground-breaking, beautiful, challenging, rewarding Audio Game.  (Pronounced &lsquo;or-if-eye&rsquo;)  *****  &#34;Aurifi marks the beginning of a completely new genre of gaming&#34; - BornTechie  &#34;4 out of 5 : Download this app if you&#39;re ready to try a state-of-the-art audio game&#34; - Snapcase07, Appolicious  &#34;Aurifi is unlike any game available for the iPhone, and is likely the first of its kind for any gaming device.&#34; - Appolicious  &#34;Aurifi uses a finely-woven tapestry of sound effects and music to create a gaming experience unlike anything you&#39;ve experienced before.&#34; -TouchMyApps  &#34;5 New App Store Games to Watch&#34; - TouchMyApps (writing of Aurifi)  &#34;Welcome to the advent of audio games on the iPhone and iPod Touch&#34; - N4G  &#34;This concept is totally revolutionary... This is one of the must have games. I LOVE IT!&#34; - Davide  &#34;...an enjoyable and oddly hypnotic experience.&#34; - PocketGamer  *****  It is the first audio-only game for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Aurifi combines the two things the iPhone and iPod Touch do best - music and organic interaction.  What is an Audio Game?  You can play Aurifi with your eyes closed, this is a 100% sonic experience.   In video games, players interact with graphics, moving them, aligning them, and reacting to them. In the Aurifi Audio Game, players interact with sound in very much the same way. Sounds different? It is!  Aurifi is an ever-changing sonic landscape that is breathtaking. At the same time it invites you to react, control, fine-tune, identify and dial yourself into your surroundings. The bespoke musical elements are designed to help you feel moods, emotions and progression.  Aurifi was developed specifically for the iPhone and iPod Touch platforms, to make best use of the device&rsquo;s methods of interaction. Shake, slide and tilt to control the sounds and complete the challenges, and also contribute to the sound.  About the Audio  Video Game makers pour loads of time and effort into making the visual appearance of games spectacular - we have done the same for the audio in Aurifi. Each sound element has been carefully crafted to provide you with a luscious experience that sounds incredible.  You need to wear earphones or headphones to play. Once you are plugged in to Aurifi, you will realise that the &lsquo;game environment&rsquo; is massive - you interact with sounds in a 3D audio environment with intense depth. We have designed Aurifi to &lsquo;break outside&rsquo; of the device, and get away from the limitations of that small screen.   You know that rush that you get when a big beat or bass-line come in on your favourite records? THAT is the reward in Aurifi - as you pass each micro-challenge, you hear another layer of the music, and they are designed to sound great.  A staggering number of audio samples have been written to work with each other. This means we can mix-up the experience, so you very rarely hear the same music twice. No pre-defined musical path here - we&rsquo;ve created an entirely new audio game engine to vary the audio experience each time you play.  Like any iPhone or iPod Touch experience, the quality of audio experience can be enhanced by the use of excellent earphones or headphones.  If all this sounds great, but you want to hear it before you buy, go to aurifi.com to listen to the audio demo. Make sure you come back!  Allow yourself to fall in love with Aurifi.  Aurifi has been created for iPhone and iPod Touch by an award-winning team of concept designers, developers, musicians, sound designers and engineers.\", \"genre\": [\"Action\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-05-20\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-154828-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-154828-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Ai...Sengoku Spirits Gaiden: Hideyoshi-Hen\", \"title_search\": \"aisengoku spirits gaiden hideyoshihen\", \"title_keyword\": \"aisengoku spirits gaiden hideyoshihen\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ai-sengoku-spirits-gaiden-hideyoshi-hen/\", \"summary\": null, \"genre\": [\"Strategy\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-05-19\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-154895-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-154895-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": null, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"Japan\"], \"companies\": [\"Tasuke (Publisher)\", \"Papillon (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"DS\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"WoundedMan\", \"title_search\": \"woundedman\", \"title_keyword\": \"woundedman\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/woundedman/\", \"summary\": \"Yessir, it&#39;s only 99c!

However, if you don&#39;t have The Quest, you can also play the expansion as a standalone game.  You&#39;re called to the northern port of Seversk in deep winter to join the Tzar, his militia and navy for a final assault on the fortress of Kozney the Deathless.  Kozney has new allies, elves and dwarf blacksmiths, as well as the spirits of his mighty, cunning dragons to back him up. Enjoy one of Argimon&#39;s trickiest dungeons yet and learn Silvergirl&#39;s deathless secret. New monsters, new spells, roughly 60 quests will take you throughout a beautiful land, including a mysterious island, to the ocean floor and to the Underworld.  To access the new areas (not applicable if you are playing the expansion standalone), go to Mithria harbor and talk to captain Hanty, then select &#34;The Deathless&#34; as your travel destination.
