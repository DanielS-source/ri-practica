The game's story scenes were shot on film using models, miniatures and actors and then edited together with genuine archive footage to create a classic sci-fi experience that is out of this world.? Take on the Gorg in more than 40 challenging levels of revolutionary defense action.? Satellites in orbit replace the towers and grid layout used in other defense games.?

The game consists of a repeating sequence of bidding (for the right to name the trump suit and to pass cards), melding, and trick-taking. Players score points by melding various card combinations and by taking tricks.  In this version, one human player (South) plays with a computer partner (North) and two computer opponents (West and East).  (Confusingly, the word &#34;hand&#34; has two meanings in pinochle: each player&#39;s cards are called his hand; and each repeating sequence of bidding, melding and trick-taking is called a hand.)  BIDDING: Each player bids the number of points she thinks she can make with her hand. Player to the dealer&#39;s left is in for 250 points, and bidding proceeds to the left. Players who pass are out of the bidding for that hand. A typical high bid is 350 to 400 points. High bidder names the trump suit for the hand and exchanges four cards with her partner.  MELDING: Players get points by showing various card combinations. A run (or straight) in the trump suit is worth 150 points. Aces in all four suits is 100 points. Pinochle (queen of spades and jack of diamonds) is 40 points, or 300 points for double pinochle (two of each).  (Note that the word &#34;pinochle&#34; refers to either the game itself, or it refers to the card combination in one&#39;s hand of queen of spades and jack of diamonds.)  TRICKS: Play begins with the high bidder, and proceeds around the table to the left, four cards per trick. Each trick has a winner, who gets 10 points per ace, ten or king.  SCORING: If the high bidder fails to make the bid (his team&#39;s total meld plus trick points is less than the bid), the bid amount is subtracted from the team score. Play continues until one team&#39;s total score reaches 1500.\", \"genre\": [\"Board\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-12-20\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-154929-52.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-154929-52.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"fishdog.net (Publisher)\", \"fishdog.net (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"G.G Series: Dark Spirits\", \"title_search\": \"gg series dark spirits\", \"title_keyword\": \"gg series dark spirits\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/g-g-series-dark-spirits/\", \"summary\": \"In this side-scrolling shooter, it's up to you to destroy the enemy by making use of the four familiars that fly in formation around your vessel.

Staquake: ZX Spectrum is also available in this stand-alone form. It does not include any other ZX Spectrum games but it does include an infinite lives version.  Starquake: ZX Spectrum is the 100% original ZX Spectrum game, as written by Dave Collins and Stephen Crow and published by Bubble Bus software in 1985 and is brought to you - as an officially licenced product - utilizing our ZX Spectrum: Elite Collection technology.  PLOT: The player controls BLOB (Bio-Logically Operated Being), whose starship has crashed on a planet. The crash destabilised the core of this planet, and you have to find its parts which are scattered all through the planet and fix it before it explodes. The natural inhabitants of the planet don&#39;t like your presence and keep trying to kill you.  There are several features of Starquake which help it stand out from other platform games of the era.  TRANSPORTATION: Within the game, there are many ways to get around;     * Running is the default, and Blob can move pretty quickly.     * Hover platforms can be used to fly. Items can&#39;t be picked up while on a hover platform, though.     * Blob can build his own short-lived platforms to reach high places.     * There are also multiple teleport booths scattered around the play area, each with its own destination code.  INVENTORY: Blob is able to carry up to four items at once, using a FIFO arrangement. Some of the items encountered will be useful to repair the core, while others will need to be exchanged using a Cheops Pyramid for something more useful. There is also an Access card, which can fill in for any of the numbered chips needed to get through some doors, and for using the aforementioned Pyramid.
