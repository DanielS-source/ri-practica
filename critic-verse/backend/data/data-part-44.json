Rather, you SHRINK pieces until they disappear!  DropZap 2 takes gameplay from the original DropZap to a whole new level by having two kinds of pieces -- one behaving identically to pieces in DropZap and another that prevents lasers from reaching other pieces.  Gameplay video:  <a href=\\\"http://www.dropzap2.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">http://www.dropzap2.com</a>  If you are a fan of the original DropZap -- or games such as Tetris, Drop7, Bejeweled 2, etc. -- then you will definitely want to check out DropZap 2!  DropZap 2 supports Game Center, the Retina display, and fast app switching (subject to availability on your device).  HOW TO PLAY  Tap/drag to select the column where you want the circle to land.  When any piece lands, it SHRINKS pieces below and sideways.  The smallest square, colored red, disappears when shrunk.  Squares and gaps, unlike circles, stop lasers from reaching pieces.  Your game ends when the grid is full or piece(s) go beyond the top.  When a piece disappears, any piece(s) above it will fall, potentially resulting in other pieces disappearing, and so on.  Chain reactions can be quite elaborate and are an integral part of gameplay.   GAME MODES  (1) Standard:  Remove (at least) 50 pieces to proceed to the next level.  (2) Relentless:  There is only one level that never ends.  (3) Action:  Remove (at least) 50 pieces to proceed to the next level.  Quick thinking is required.  (4) Relentless Action:  There is only one level that never ends.  Quick thinking is required.  (5) Two Players:  This a split-screen mode where two players compete using the same device.  The player who removes 25 more pieces than his/her opponent or outlasts his/her opponent wins.   GAME CENTER AND LOCAL SCORES  Single player game modes have global scores via Game Center.
