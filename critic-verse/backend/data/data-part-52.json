Your Mission: Collect as many gems as you can and last as long as possible in this action-packed game of survival.  The Complication: Dynamite, laser-beams, and a bottomless pit must be avoided to elude your impending demise. Only the quick will survive...   SUMMARY:  Diaballic is an endless, side-scrolling action platformer in which you, a metal ball-bearing, must survive as long as possible. Platforms fly in from the right; you must navigate around obstacles and avoid falling to your death. For maximum points, however, collect the precious gems that come your way.   FEATURES:   - 4 difficulty levels: (Easy, Medium, Hard, &amp; Diaballic) with faster scrolling-speeds.   - Various kinds of obstacles, gems, and platforms to make you think before you leap.   - Controlled, random level design, so no two games are ever alike!   - Both GLOBAL and LOCAL high score lists for each difficulty level so you can compete with your friends.   - Customizable control settings so you have no excuses for lackluster performance!   CONTROLS:  - Onscreen arrow buttons that you can place on either side of the screen.   - A large &#34;Jump&#34; button. You can &#34;double-jump&#34; by tapping the button twice. (HINT: this ability is your lifeline!).   - Controls have customizable transparency. Want to see the whole screen? Just make them disappear.   Diaballic is both fast-paced and addictive. Games rarely last more than a few minutes, and if they do, you should ramp up the difficulty. Trust us, &#34;Diaballic&#34; difficulty is, well, diabolical. And don&#39;t worry, the slow-and-simple &#34;Easy&#34; mode will help beginners conquer the short learning curve.  Happy leaping!

The basic game rules are simple - you slide rows and columns of colored tiles to combine groups (vertical or horizontal lines) of the same color and double-tap to remove them from the screen. Using multicolored tiles you can create color chains - intersecting lines of tiles which will be submitted as a single group, giving you much higher score!   As difficulty levels progress, bigger tiles are introduced, making the matching more challenging. Also, tiles react to gravity, so tilting in combination with sliding can be a very useful play technique!   The game includes 3 game modes each with 4 difficulty settings to provide plenty of variety and a great challenge.   *PUZZLE (it&#39;s a puzzle, unlimited time)   *COLOR RUSH (fast paced action)   *ZEN COLORS (endless mode, for relaxed playing)    If you like games like Collapse! Chaos, Trism, Bejeweled or TETRIS, you will enjoy this game.   If you are tired of match 3 puzzles - try this one, it has a few unique features you&#39;re likely to enjoy!    If you don&#39;t like puzzle games - try this game, very possibly it will make you change your mind (it already has for some people)!  -------------------------- See what the beta-testers of the game say:  &#34;I just wanted to let you know that this is a great concept. It&#39;s about time somebody went beyond the whole match three thing and did something different.&#34;  &#34;Really nice and polished game.&#34;  &#34;I didn&#39;t think I would like this game as much as I do. I&#39;m so addicted to it right now, so I really recommend it. My top 3 puzzle games right now - in order - Quadrum:Colors, Fuzzle and Trism.&#34;  &#34;At first load-up, the game seemed to me to be the &#34;same old&#34; match game, but after playing it for a while, I see that there is a lot more strategy than the &#34;same old&#34; formula.&#34;  &#34;I tend to get quickly bored with color matching games. But the puzzle mode and zen mode offer that puzzling challenge that should hold my interest over the long term.

Now, on with the show!  This is X-Plane GLIDER, a REALLY fun little X-Plane app that lets you do some really fun GLIDING!  Here is how it works: You start off in either of 2 gliders: A nice ASk-21 composite trainer, or a Schemp-Hirth high-performance sailplane. You are on the runway, with a towplane in front of you, engine running, ready to go. Release the brakes to command the towplane to take off and away you go! The towplane will take you as high as you like, and you will hold formation behind him as he pulls you to altitude.  WARNING!! THE TOW-ROPE THAT ATTACHES YOUR PLANE TO HIS IS HOOKED TO HIS TAIL, AND YOUR NOSE, WITH REALISTIC PHYSICS. IF YOU PULL YOUR GLIDER LEFT, RIGHT, UP, OR DOWN, IT WILL PULL HIS TAIL IN THAT DIRECTION, PULLING HIM OFF COURSE, OR ULTIMATELY INTO A STALL OR SPIN IF YOU PULL TOO HARD. AT THIS POINT, YOU WILL HAVE CAUSED THE TOWPLANE TO CRASH, WHICH IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC SINCE YOU ARE ATTACHED TO HIM WITH A TOW-ROPE! The dynamics of the resulting crash are... &#39;interesting&#39; ;-)  Once you have gotten a successful ride to altitude, the REAL fun begins: GLIDING! X-Plane glider simulates RIDGE LIFT. This is a phenomenon where the WIND blows UP and OVER the mountains, climbing or descending to follow the contours of the terrain. Your mission as a glider pilot is pretty clear: Watch the wind and the slope of the terrain carefully to hold inside the UPWARD-MOVING areas of air, using the lift of the air flowing UP the mountain-slope to hold you aloft! If you set a good 25-knot wind, and then fly along the WINDWARD side of a nice steep mountain, then you can get a really-nice free elevator ride to 10,000 feet in the right flying regions! This is called RIDGE LIFT.  Innsbruck, Austria, as well as a number of other amazing flying regions are provided to let you soar across all manner of amazing terrain with steep, tall mountains, watching that wind indicator in the lower-left to see what the wind direction and speed are, then hunting for the perfect mountain-slope at a right angle to that wind, pushing the air up into a free elevator for you to ride to altitude!  Helping you along is an instrument called the TOTAL ENERGY VARIOMETER. If it is BEEPING, then  you have found a nice updraft from the air following the terrain... circle in that area to ride the climbing air to altitude! If you hear a STEADY tone, then you are in DESCENDING air... you have probably let yourself be blown to the wrong side of the mountain!!! You are now in DESCENDING air, and a crash will follow soon if you do not find a way out of that area!  Now, here is where it gets REALLY crazy: MULTIPLAYER! You can do multiplayer gliding with your friends, working on formation flying with gliders (do the RANDOM START to start in the air... you can see your friend as an icon in the bottom-center of the screen to fly to meet him), or, for more fun than a barrel full of monkeys, ONE of you should get in the Cessna 172 that is provided with the sim, and tow the other person aloft! With one of you acting as the towplane, and the other as the glider, you can have fun finding the perfect place to soar. BUT, READ THE TEXT ABOVE ON HOW IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE GLIDER TO CRASH THE TOWPLANE! Hold position right behind the towplane carefully.. unless, of course, you WANT him to crash! ;-) After all... you can always RELEASE the tow-rope after you have put your friend in a spin, leaving him to crash as you go soaring! ;-)\", \"genre\": [\"Aircraft Sim\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-11-05\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-133508-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-133508-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Laminar Research (Developer)\", \"Laminar Research (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"World Party Games\", \"title_search\": \"world party games\", \"title_keyword\": \"world party games\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/world-party-games/\", \"summary\": \"Play exciting new and innovative games from around the globe!

Your times may very and will get better with the number of puzzles you solve. As in all Sudoku games with AutoFill notes mode enabled: it is just too easy to play levels 1 and 2, so use it for higher levels. Double-tap shortcuts reduce the solving time by 10 - 20%.

The new level setting will take effect when you start a new puzzle.  FEATURES EXPLAINED: - AutoFill Mode - all notes will be automatically populated and then kept in sync with the numbers you enter. You can remove notes. You can add notes only if you previously removed them. In this mode the game does everything for you and lets you do the thinking. You can switch back to manual mode - the auto-populated notes will remain. - Manual Mode - you are responsible for adding/removing notes. No restrictions.  - Manual Mode with &#34;smart notes&#34; - you are responsible for adding/removing notes, but the game will auto cleanup the corresponding notes when you enter a new number. If you change your mind and remove the number the game will put them back. In manual mode you can use the &#34;Clear Notes&#34; button to clear all notes.  - DOUBLE-TAP SHORTCUTS - very convenient for this type of big puzzle: 1. If you want to quickly remove a number you entered - just double-tap it 2. When there is only one note in a certain square - double tap it and the note will become the number 3. If a row, column or sub-square is populated with unique numbers and there is only one number left - double-tap the square - the remaining number will appear.  - Conflict alert - it will show you that you have entered a wrong number.
