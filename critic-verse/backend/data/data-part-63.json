Taking the role of one of 5 characters, the player must band together with other legendary heroes to face this Dragon and defeat the forces of Chaos in the \\\"Mage Knight\\\" universe. Team dynamics are vital in Mage Knight Apocalypse, and players need to select their party carefully, combining melee, ranged and magical strikes in conjunction with overwhelming group combo attacks to triumph in battle. Players can quest alone or with friends in five-player cooperative and competitive play modes, working together or going head-to-head in the ultimate clash for battlefield supremacy.  Players can choose from five distinct character classes and customize them with hundreds of weapons, armor and items, equipping the right gear for each intense encounter.  Unlike other action RPGs, in Mage Knight Apocalypse, players have no need to worry about ability points or discreet levels to gain.  Instead, character development depends on what type of playing style the player enjoys.  Swinging a heavy sword makes you stronger, casting spells makes your magic more powerful, and shooting bows improve dexterity.  The skills players use and the way they use them determines how the character develops.
