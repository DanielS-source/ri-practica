Such an image is made by superimposing two separate images, one for each eye and with geometric offset to each other, to produce a stereo 3D effect.Where to get anaglyph glasses?By searching the keyword &quot;anaglyph 3D glasses&quot; from the Internet, you will find quite a few manufactures and retailers who sell such glasses. Some of them offer free pairs of anaglyph glasses as samples; all you need to do is to send them a self-addressed stamped envelope.Choose correct glasses typeGlasses type names correspond to lens colors (left - right) of the glasses. Please choose the one that matches your actual glasses' lens colors. Note that this application uses patent-free color encodings, so that expected stereoscopic effects may not be fully achieved by patented anaglyph glasses.Vision health in wearing anaglyph glassesProlonged viewing of anaglyph images may cause strain, dizziness, or visual color incorrectness for the eyes and therefore is not recommended, particularly for children. It is recommended that you switch back to normal 3D view to have your eyes relaxed after wearing anaglyph glasses for a while.\", \"genre\": [\"Racing\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2011-06-24\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-197353-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-197353-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"OmniG Software Inc.

At least you have a cutter to defend yourself but the truth is that it\\u2019s pretty improbable that you can resist for much longer\\u2026or do you think you can?  Paper Zombie is a daring mix of two of the most successful kinds of video games in the world:  \\u201cshooter\\u201d and \\u201cstrategy\\u201d.  The game oozes with tons of fast action where your mission consists of facing challenging waves of zombies in relatively short but very exciting and intensive stages. You will need all your skills to fight them, but at the same time, also your intelligence to choose the appropriate weapons that allow you to finish each stage without any trouble and manage to escape from Zombie Town!Luckily you have three kinds of different weapons, each one with its own capabilities.  You should combine them to succeed at this unevenly-matched fight.- Cutting weapons.   Everyone knows that one of the best ways to destroy paper is cutting it, but you\\u2019ll need to be relatively close to the zombies.  - Shooting weapons. Shoot at the zombies to knock them down but remember that you may only have a limited amount of bullets.- Launching weapons. Paper burns easily.  Launch firebombs to the areas plagued by zombies to finish them off but be careful that there aren\\u2019t any innocent ones in the area!Paper Zombie isn\\u2019t just another game.  It takes 3D capabilities of the handheld device to the limit, with user friendliness, an audiovisual display and depth to the game that has never been seen before on this platform and even more so on
