Earth's only defence is the Spectrum organisation, a world security force now focused solely on defeating the Mysteron menace.  Players take control of the indestructible Captain Scarlet as well as Captain Blue and the other Spectrum agents as they rescue crashed Angel pilots, investigate Egyptian tombs, halt the destruction of an underwater base and much more in their battle against Captain Black and the rest of the Mysterons.  The fight against the Mysterons takes place across a wide range of levels from fog shrouded docks to polar oil refineries to Cloudbase, the home of Spectrum itself. Each level features highly detailed graphics that capture the look and feel of Captain Scarlet. Players will also use a variety of vehicles including Spectrum Saloon Cars, Angel Interceptors and of course the legendary Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle.\", \"genre\": [\"Real-Time Strategy\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": null, \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-52420-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-52420-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"Europe\", \"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Digital Workshop (Publisher)\", \"Batfish Studios (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Monster Madness\", \"title_search\": \"monster madness\", \"title_keyword\": \"monster madness\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/monster-madness/\", \"summary\": \"Our story begins in a typical house on a Friday night, one seemingly like any other within the quiet, safe streets of Suburbia.

Intended for children ages 3-6, the game is designed to teach basic skills to prepare kids for success in kindergarten and provide a foundation for further learning. The game's main character, Reader Rabbit, and his sidekick, Sam the Lion, are flying their airship over a new island when they are mysteriously captured by a giant bubble wrap. They then come to realize they have landed in Balloon Town, an island made of balloons where all sharp objects including their airship are locked away in a palace. In order to free their airship and continue on their journey, they must first gain access to the palace by helping the band wake-up the sleeping bull in front of the palace. To do this they must gather the 5 different instruments for the band that have been scattered around Balloon Town. In order to receive an instrument, players must help Reader Rabbit and Sam in a series of educational mini-games designed to teach kids basic skills such as memory, recognizing patters, simple math, phonics, rhyming, following directions and placing items in order. All mini-games have simplistic point-and-click controls using the Nintendo DS touch screen interface. Once players have retrieved all of the instruments and gained access to the palace, they must complete two more mini-games (a listening comprehension/sequencing game and a reading skills game) before gaining access to their airship so they can continue on to a new adventure. The game is presented in a colorful cartoon style with short videos, full voice acting, and sing-along songs designed to engage young children while still teaching basic skills. Players will be able to adjust the difficulty level of all mini-games independently which can add hours of replay value.\", \"genre\": [\"Edutainment\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2001-06-22\", \"images\": [], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\", \"Europe\"], \"companies\": [\"The Learning Company (Publisher)\", \"The Learning Company (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\", \"DS\", \"Wii\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Gyromancer\", \"title_search\": \"gyromancer\", \"title_keyword\": \"gyromancer\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/gyromancer/\", \"summary\": \"Gyromanceris a puzzle-roleplaying game (RPG) featuring a unique battle system based on Bejeweled Twist combined with elements of Square Enix role-playing games.

The basic game rules are simple - you slide rows and columns of colored tiles to combine groups (vertical or horizontal lines) of the same color and double-tap to remove them from the screen. Using multicolored tiles you can create color chains - intersecting lines of tiles which will be submitted as a single group, giving you much higher score!   As difficulty levels progress, bigger tiles are introduced, making the matching more challenging. Also, tiles react to gravity, so tilting in combination with sliding can be a very useful play technique!   The game includes 3 game modes each with 4 difficulty settings to provide plenty of variety and a great challenge.   *PUZZLE (it&#39;s a puzzle, unlimited time)   *COLOR RUSH (fast paced action)   *ZEN COLORS (endless mode, for relaxed playing)    If you like games like Collapse! Chaos, Trism, Bejeweled or TETRIS, you will enjoy this game.   If you are tired of match 3 puzzles - try this one, it has a few unique features you&#39;re likely to enjoy!    If you don&#39;t like puzzle games - try this game, very possibly it will make you change your mind (it already has for some people)!  -------------------------- See what the beta-testers of the game say:  &#34;I just wanted to let you know that this is a great concept. It&#39;s about time somebody went beyond the whole match three thing and did something different.&#34;  &#34;Really nice and polished game.&#34;  &#34;I didn&#39;t think I would like this game as much as I do. I&#39;m so addicted to it right now, so I really recommend it. My top 3 puzzle games right now - in order - Quadrum:Colors, Fuzzle and Trism.&#34;  &#34;At first load-up, the game seemed to me to be the &#34;same old&#34; match game, but after playing it for a while, I see that there is a lot more strategy than the &#34;same old&#34; formula.&#34;  &#34;I tend to get quickly bored with color matching games. But the puzzle mode and zen mode offer that puzzling challenge that should hold my interest over the long term.
