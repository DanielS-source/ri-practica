Optia&#39;s intuitive gameplay and gorgeous graphics (not to mention 100 engrossing levels) make it easy to pick up and hard to put down. It&#39;s great to play while waiting for a bus or in a boring lecture.

Great fun for the Kids and Adults!  To celebrate Halloween, Tin Man Games have created a brand new Frootrees experience with brand new art and an eery new soundtrack! Pluck the freaky Froot from the Frootree and place them in the correct crates. It&#39;s not as easy as it looks though, with ways to boost your score by effectively using multiplier bonuses and the infamous Frootrees upward flick! We have AGON online scoring if you think you&#39;re good enough to compete with the rest of the world!  Original Frootrees Feeback: -------------- &#34;I have to say that the risk vs. reward mechanism in this game is brilliant. You want to do the lob move, to get the local multipliers, but it takes much more skill than the drag move. It&#39;s also interesting that the low-threat, early to mid-game is when the lob is the easiest to pull off, but it is in the end-game, when you have racked up a higher global modifier that it really matters. The more I play this, the more I like it.  I really recommend this title, if you guys and girls have overlooked it, for whatever reason. I have consistently returned to it, because TheTinMan [Tin Man Games] has hit on such a perfect combination of simplicity and depth. The screenshots really don&#39;t do it justice, because the game is very involving. I&#39;m not even sure that a video would capture it either; you really need to play it.&#34; - DJ Flippy, Touch Arcade Forums  &#34;&hellip;Overall I give this app 4.5 out of 5 because its very well written&hellip;it&rsquo;s a great game that I would recommend to anyone!&#34; - App Tap Reviews  &#34;&hellip;it is games like Frootrees that I have a great deal of respect for. You are seeing a lot of games come out that are take offs on a good idea. This is not a negative, but those games become over done and the originality is gone.   Frootrees by Tin Man Games is an original fun game for the iPhone and iPod Touch.&#34; - Crazy Mike&#39;s Apps  &#34;Frootrees is a cute app. Sickeningly cute. The artwork is what stands out most, as it is a Nick Jr. Cartoon design, but the voices of the red apples and purple plums will catch your attention. If you can imagine South Park character Ike&rsquo;s Kindergarten classroom, you can think of the voices. They&rsquo;re simply too cute to listen to.  Adults will like the challenging time frame of being consistent and will try to have the highest score. I am looking forward to best my score of 326 soon enough because I know I can and that is what you want from an iPhone/iPod Touch app &ndash; replay value.&#34; - App Girl Reviews\", \"genre\": [\"Edutainment\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-10-29\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-133178-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-133178-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Tin Man Games (Publisher)\", \"Tin Man Games (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}"]
