In the Attack mode, shoot colored bubbles at a spinning circle and try to shrink it.  If you get 3 or more colors in a row the bubbles are destroyed.  Otherwise the circle can grow.  Once it is large enough to hit you the game ends.In the Defend mode, shoot colored bubbles at a spinning ring of bubbles that surrounds you.  If you get 3 or more colors in a row the bubbles are destroyed.  Otherwise the ring can start shrinking around you.  Once it reaches you the game ends.How to play:Simply shoot bubbles, trying to get 3 or more bubbles of the same color next to each other.  Try to finish a level to go to the next, where you get more points for each destroyed bubble.  At the beginning, try to reduce the number of bubbles by destroying three or more at a time.  When their number has decreased, aim to remove bubbles of the same color.  Once all bubbles of a certain color are gone, the color won't come back, make it easier to remove bubbles of the remaining colors.Each bubble is worth 1 point times the level you're playing so the higher the level, the more points you earn.  However the higher the level, the more bubbles that can fall and the number of colors also increases.Each game (Attack & Defend) uses the Game Center and maintains its own high score so you can know how well you did.In the two player mode, a bubble of each color floats away and lands on the screen of the other player.  Game Center also tracks how many others you've defeated or been defeated by in the two player mode.  Two player modes cane against friends (using Bluetooth) or against random players (using Game Center).  Two player games do not end, the other player scores a win for each time the other player &quot;loses&quot;.Advanced tips:You can not really throw away bubbles you do not need.  If a bubble leaves the screen, it will come back the next time bubbles are added.  Because of this, make sure you do not throw away bubbles unless you really have to.  Or unless you are sure you can finish the level before the bubbles come back. Thanks for playing Bubble Wars / Orb Wars 2.0!This application includes fonts created by Dan Zadorozny.
