New characters from titles such as \\\"Destiny 2\\\" and \\\"Symphonia\\\" will be added, and Julio and Caro will have a big adventure again! In this title, in addition to the fun of wearing costumes and becoming a professional, a new system \\\"Party Battle\\\" in which up to 12 characters appear at the same time is adopted, enabling highly strategic battles with a large number of characters.   STORY There is a city in the world where each story of the \\\"Tales of\\\" series is handed down as a legend. The main characters, Julio and Caro, who yearn for legendary heroes, and their acquaintance Dr. Brown live here.  A few years ago, the ruins of an ultra-ancient civilization were found in a fissure created by an earthquake. Julio and Caro visit Dr. Brown, who studied and restored the relics found in the ruins.  Relics are timeships, boats that cross time and space. Their function is to cross time and space and go back and forth to the legendary world. The long-awaited restoration has finally been completed, and Dr. Brown is very good at it. What's more, he says he will let Julio and Caro name the timeship. The two apty named this dream machine; \\\"the Dream\\\" and they decided to go see the heroes Julio and Caro longed for the next day.  However, that night... When Julio read the heroic biography before going to bed as usual, something was wrong. The storyline was different from when he read it before. The hero who should have saved the world isn't in there time to stop the resurrection of evil The world isn't supposed to be destroyed. Julio falls asleep while complaining.  Julio and Caro are awoke by Dr. Brown's voice, shouting and with his brown hair disturbed. It seems that \\\"the Dream\\\" was taken away by someone last night. According to Dr. Brown, the purpose of the thief must be a modification of the legend, speculated from the change in the hero's story.  He has to be stopped, but it's impossible to create a new timeship. The three people are left wondering what to do. Suddenly, a timeship that is different from the Dream appears in front of the three.  From the inside, a white-haired man who looks just like a doctor. According to the white-haired man, he is Dr. Brown from 100 days in the future. He seems to have come here after discovering and repairing the second timeship, Dream No. 2, from the ruins.  The future 100 days later is on the verge of destruction. The cause was that the legend was modified by using the Dream that someone took away, resulting in a paradox. \\\"I had so much heartache that my hair turned white like this.\\\" He called himself Dr. White.  Julio and Caro try to get into Dream 2 at once. However, the two doctors stop Julio and Caro, who are about to leave for the momentum. Dr. Brown said, \\\"Why are you dressed like that and are you going to go without any preparation?\\\" Another relic was found in the ruins.  It is a transformation device that can transform a person, placing them into various roles. With Narikiri Clothes and Dream No. 2, I'm sure you can change any miserable fate.

This includes the unique 'Team Battle' mode, which doesn't utilize the traditional first, second and third place finishes. Players win the race by depleting their rival's Spirit Points, which are decreased by contact with walls, cars and by falling behind other racers. Divided into 15 areas, two teams compete to dominate the game map through individual races between the different players. By earning points for each victory, players can judge how they stack up against their rivals and cherry-pick their competition from the player roster as they look to seize territories. Win and increase team loyalty, recruit defeated riders and increase your supremacy on the streets while being upgraded in the rankings. But lose, and learn quickly that there are no points for second place in street racing. In addition to Street Supremacy\\u2019s stunning racing action, the cars in the game can also be modified to add an edge to the duels. The game's authentically modeled Nissans, Mitsubishis and Subarus can all be enhanced with new exhausts, paint jobs and spoilers. These all prove vital in shaving seconds off the lap times, while stickers and fancy lights can also be used to enhance the car's aesthetics, adding a layer of gloss to an already entertaining racer video game. Additionally, Street Supremacy also takes advantage of the PSP system's wireless functionality by letting gamers compete against a second player in the Vs. mode for a gripping head-to-head racing experience.

EASY TO START, HARD TO MASTERThe game has 2 campaigns. &quot;Behind the walls&quot; campaign is more similar to the classic breakout game while &quot;Insane freedom&quot; requires fast reaction and all your dexterity.I'M NUMBER ONEThis is a challenge game. 20 tricky achievements will indicate your progress. Are you fast and accurate enough? Compete with your friends or any player in the world with Game Center leaderboards. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;GAME CONTROLSThe game offers 2 type of controls - tap the paddle and drag it or control the paddle via on-screen controls. While the first variant is easy to start to feel the game the second one requires some learning but it brings fantastic results when you get used to it.THROUGH YOUR JOURNEY YOU WILL ENCOUNTER:- 2 separate campaigns with 30 arenas each.- Dynamic arenas: levels will have moving/rotating, destroyable and indestructible objects and turrets that try to shoot you.- Ammunition: manually activated reflective shields to use in panic moments.- Ammunition: fire missiles to destroy some remaining objects or shoot the turrets before they shoot you. &nbsp; &nbsp;- 15 power-ups and power-downs to gain additional score, replenish ammunition or modify the game play.- Game center support with leaderboards and achievements.- Stylish cyberpunk graphic and musicCybernarium control code is in your hands now!VISIT US: cybernarium.com (for video, screens, etc) &nbsp;LIKE US: facebook.com/smartphonewareFOLLOW US: twitter.com/smartphonewareOTHER GAMES AND APPS: smartphoneware.com\", \"genre\": [\"Board\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2011-11-20\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-215627-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-215627-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Smartphoneware (Publisher)\", \"Smartphoneware (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"The Show Must Go On\", \"title_search\": \"the show must go on\", \"title_keyword\": \"the show must go on\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-show-must-go-on/\", \"summary\": \"FOUR SHOWS!
