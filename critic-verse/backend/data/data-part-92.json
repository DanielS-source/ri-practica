YES, PHYSICS *CAN* BE FUN!!! Use gravity to your advantage in this addicting physics-based action game!  ? The Goal Fill more than 66% of the screen with shapes to complete a level. The game ends when you run out of shapes. Sounds easy, right? Think again! There are enemy particles and other shapes to worry about!  ? Creating a Shape To create a shape, simply touch the screen. Keep pressing to make bigger shapes. The shape drops to the bottom of the screen when you release your touch.  ? Enemies Look out for enemies when creating a shape. If they hit a growing shape before you drop it, the shape will be lost and you have one less shape to complete the level.  ? Rotating the Screen The shapes always fall to the bottom of the screen. You can rotate the screen to any angle you want. This is a good strategy to keep the enemies out of your way!  ? Scoring You get points for every shape you drop. When you complete a level, you get bonus points based on how many shapes you have left, how fast you completed the level, and how much of the screen you filled.  ? Zones There are several Zones in the game. Each one has its own shape. To unlock a Zone, you have to complete at least 9 levels from the Zone before it. The last Zone has a surprise, so be careful!  ? Pausing the Play To pause the game, simply double-tap the screen.  ? Game Saving Your progress is automatically saved as you play. Whenever you start a new level, that information is remembered. So if your game gets interrupted, you can continue where you left off the next time you launch the game.  ? The Toy Box In this mode, you can create any shape you wish. Simply touch the icon in the panel and create a shape as normal. You can create up to 20 shapes. You can move shapes around, delete them, and even clear the screen to start over. There are no enemies to worry about in the Toy Box, so enjoy yourself!   ? FEATURES ? Real physics-based interaction; watch the different shapes hit and roll off each other based on real mass and gravity! ? Use the accelerometer to change gravity...you can use this to your advantage ? Unlimited levels...your only limitation is how well you do ? 6 different Zones to play...each one offers unique challenges ? Global online leaderboards...rank yourself amongst other players worldwide! 6 different leaderboards to rank your scores.

Enjoyed by over 7.5 million PC users worldwide, Dropsum will stretch your mental agility and give your brain a good work out.  In DropSum you drop numbered balls into a grid. The aim is to make a line of these balls add up to 9, either horizontally or vertically.  When you make nine you score some points and all the balls involved change color. They start out grey and advance to blue, yellow and then red. Once a red ball has been used to make a sum of nine it will explode and allow any balls above it to fill the gap. The falling numbers then have the potential to form scoring combinations with their new neighbors, which may burst other balls, and so on. Setting up large combos like this is the way to score serious points. The game ends when the whole grid is filled.  Destroy special octagon tiles and you&#39;ll release a special star. These stars are gathered up after a short while. The more stars gathered, the higher the bonus you&#39;ll receive.
