The character ventures on an expedition into the Antarctic wastes that takes her underground and into the center of the Earth. Project 9 is a series of games based on and inspired by factual subject matter:In recent years, a variety of mysterious phenomena have appeared more and more frequently, UFOs frequently appear around the world and extreme weather has become very common. The latest publically released official files report numerous incredible events. Early in World War II, Nazi engineers and scientists planned to create a circular, dish-shaped aircraft. Investment in these vehicles may have led to the defeat of the Nazis in Europe and their relocation to the Antarctic. Hitler's death in the historical records remains an unsolved mystery. Many files show that Nazis had sent troops to the South Pole and Tibet in search of the so-called entrance to the center of the Earth. The legend of the Antarctic underground Aryan city has begun to receive more and more attention, and scholars have paid more attention to the Hollow Earth Theory.Visual Park's imagination takes you into a fantasy world in the center of the Earth. The journey is fraught with peril and difficulty. The path from the surface of the Antarctic ice sheet toward the center of the earth includes confusing puzzles, fights with ferocious unknown creatures, and avoiding dangerous obstacles in the floating state all the while bearing seismic activity, extreme temperatures, bizarre accidents and magnetic reversals. Of course the highly intelligent protagonist will collect a variety of items to overcome suffering and break through to hindrances. Certainly it is necessary to live smartly and bravely, as the protagonist moves forward through the adventure. Countless treasures, beautiful monuments and mysterious forces await your arrival.The heroes available have been named DML-9, DML-4, DML-1. Inferred in accordance with this figure, the protagonist will also be called a DML, a code name for a series of intelligent robots, and at least nine different machines. How the game will appear in its final form is still a puzzle.The protagonist himself is a mystery. At first in the Nazi base, he seems to be enslaved by the Nazis to detect the center of the Earth and its secrets. These robots are highly intelligent and there is no doubt that in that era the Nazi had no way to create such a state-of-the-art machine body. Accordingly, the DML has become a major secret, requiring players to slowly open the series of games to explore Project 9.---KEY FEATURES---?Developed on the Unity 3D 3.5 engine, the latest technology available on mobile devices.?Brilliant graphics bring a fairy tale-like visual experience.?Simple control-style removes operational difficulties.?Adventure-Puzzle game with story mode.?Free change of characters' related sound, bring more fun to you.?Changing game pace and rhythm make for relaxation and high-energy excitement.?Many choice of route to accomplish missions, each has different feelings.?NOTES?+Play on iPhone 4,iPhone 4S, iPod touch 4.+Optimized for iPhone 4S!

Create a game and invite friends from your neighborhood or city.  ASSASSINS AND TARGETS Every player in the game assumes a dual role: At all times, you are both an assassin and a target. As an assassin, you are always assigned one target. Your job is to eliminate as many targets as possible in a sequential fashion.   As a target, you will be hunted by a single assassin -- in most cases, someone different than your target. Your job is to avoid elimination by that assassin. You will be given no information as to the identity or location of who is hunting you.  GOALS 1. Eliminate your target(s).  2. Avoid being eliminated by another assassin.   Once the game begins, it runs nonstop, 24/7, until there&#39;s only one assassin standing. You&#39;re not just playing Assassin -- you are living it.  ELIMINATION Assassins use photos (i.e., camera, iPhone) as the only method of elimination. A successful elimination occurs when you are able to &#34;shoot&#34; your target and send the photo to be approved. Once you have made the elimination, you inherit that player&#39;s current target, while your assassin continues to hunt you.\", \"genre\": [\"RPG\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-03-09\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-115652-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-115652-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Longtail Studios (Developer)\", \"Longtail Studios (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Crazy Penguin Catapult\", \"title_search\": \"crazy penguin catapult\", \"title_keyword\": \"crazy penguin catapult\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/crazy-penguin-catapult/\", \"summary\": \"------------------------------------------- Jurassic 3D Rollercoaster Rush&trade; coming soon - the followup to the smash hit iPhone game! -------------------------------------------  CRAZY PENGUIN CATAPULT 2 LEVEL PACK - COMING SOON We&#39;re offering users a new way to play Crazy Penguin Catapult 2 via Level Packs.
