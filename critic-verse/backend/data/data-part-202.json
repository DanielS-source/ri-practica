Like every PRO Series game, Let&lsquo;em Ride PRO will provide the insight, knowledge and training to confidently play at any game table in your favorite casino.  With Let&lsquo;em Ride PRO, you can learn the rules, lingo and strategy for optimal play.   Let&lsquo;em Ride PRO also provides you the tools to memorize the payout tables to maximize your fun!  Let&rsquo;em Ride Poker is very similar to &ldquo;Let It Ride Poker&rdquo;, one the most exciting and popular casino games you can play.  The game is derived from 5 Card Stud Poker, but in this game you are not playing against the dealer or other players, only against yourself.  The goal of the game is to obtain a poker hand of a pair of tens or better.  The better the hand, the better the payout.  The game begins by placing three main bets of equal size.  You are then dealt three cards.  After seeing your first three cards, you can either bring down one of your initial bets or &ldquo;let&rsquo;em ride&rdquo; and leave it in play.  The dealer will then turn over one of his two cards.  Then you are given the same opportunity to bring down or ride another one of your initial bets.  At that point, you are paid out odds on each of your remaining bets based on having a winning hand.  If you were lucky enough to get a Royal Flush, you would be paid $1,000 to 1 on each of the bets you left on the table.  In addition to the main bet, Let&lsquo;em Ride PRO offers two additional bonus bets.  You can place a $1 Bonus Bet, which pays as high as $20,000 if you get the elusive Royal Flush.  Not a bad return on a single dollar, except that the odds of being dealt a Royal Flush are 649,750 to 1.  The game also offers a 3 Card Bonus Bet, which is placed on the first three cards you are dealt.  You can earn an extra payout with this bet, by being dealt a pair or better in your first three cards.

We&rsquo;ve listened and we&rsquo;ve responded.  Please enjoy the enhanced 2.0 version and as always, we welcome your feedback.    The Audi A4 Driving Challenge is about precision performance driving.  Use the iPhone&#39;s motion sensing accelerometers to test your skill against a series of challenging courses.  Each course includes features intended to hone your reflexes, control and anticipation.     The player will complete three laps across a series of five courses, receiving a time for each course.  Don&#39;t clip the cones!  Each cone the player hits will add a full second to their lap time.  Just like real driving, it&rsquo;s better to slow down and remain in control than to constantly speed ahead at full throttle.  Use of the brake and mastery of the course will be required to get a good time.     If you&#39;re ready for a driving skill game that isn&#39;t just &#34;pedal to the metal&#34;, this game is for you!   How to play:   Braking &amp; Acceleration  To accelerate, press the gas pedal on the right-hand side of the screen.   To slow down, press the brake pedal on the left-hand side of the screen.   Steering  Steer your Audi A4 by simply tilting your iPhone or iPod Touch to the left or right like you would a steering wheel.   Settings: Adjust the steering sensitivity, select from unlocked cars, change the camera mode, and reset your high scores from this screen.   Shadow Cars  Breaking a preset record will add a shadow car to the track. The shadow car will then replay the record-setting lap each time you play the track.  You cannot collide with the shadow car. It should be used as a guide to improve your lines around each track.   Achievements:  Each track has three achievements to master. Beat the time listed under each achievement to unlock it.  Achievements on all tracks will add new Audi vehicles for you to use. Skilled players will be rewarded with the opportunity to unlock the A4 3.2L V6 and ultimately, the R8.   Pausing Gameplay: During a race, double-tap the screen to pause the game.  From here you can either restart the game or exit back to the main menu.

Each race brings something new as you try winning the race by using any of the strategies or switch between them during the race. The key factor in the game is the SCORE. You collect score while racing. Every stunt that you perform will award you with a certain number of score. Hitting objects, driving fast, drifting they all give you a certain number of score. When you reach 1000 you can burn away your score as nitro thus getting an edge over the others. If you are in the lead you can hit more objects thus gather more score. However hitting objects may cause you to make a mistake and crash into something that is immovable. If you can be patient and gather more than 2000 score, your nitro will be even stronger. Another tactic is to select one of the super cars which are fast and have a good traction. In this case you won't gather that much score but most probably you won't need it because you don't need nitro to stay ahead.

Stuck pieces are destroyed when they touch a enemy&#39;s bullet. The slow/pull-in button lets you decrease the ship&#39;s speed and fix its direction. If you stick many pieces, enemies become more offensive and tend to fire more bullets! Its a fun challenging game and is a must have for any shmup (shoot &#39;em up) fan!  After completing this training mission, you&#39;ll be ready to enter the real game of Tumiki Fighters.\", \"genre\": [\"Action\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-10-06\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-130584-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-130584-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Dreamawake Games (Developer)\", \"Dreamawake Games (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Hearts of Iron II: Armageddon\", \"title_search\": \"hearts of iron ii armageddon\", \"title_keyword\": \"hearts of iron ii armageddon\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/hearts-of-iron-ii-armageddon/\", \"summary\": \"This download only product picks up where Hearts of Iron II: Doomsday left off.
