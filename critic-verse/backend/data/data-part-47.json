The game plays very much like pool, using intuitive touch controls.  The twist is that balls of the same colour stick together magnetically when they touch.Magnetic Billiards tables have no pockets, instead balls are removed by building clusters of connected balls, with extra rewards for creating recognised cluster shapes. Points are scored based on the skill displayed and risks taken each shot, and grades are awarded for the total score earned when a table is cleared.Clearing a table is the easy part.  Trying to earn high scores and achieve high grades is where the surprising genius of the game becomes apparent.Sure, anyone can beat an F grade, but will you ever get an A grade?  Is there a higher grade than A?  Can you unlock all the tables?Although easy to play the game is fiendishly addictive, as the simple game mechanic is deceptively subtle and deep.  Even after months of play you'll still be figuring out new ways to beat your previous best scores and grades.As you aim for higher and higher you'll realise that no two games of Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint are ever alike.  Re-playing each table presents you with an endlessly fascinating challenge, as new strategic decisions need to be made with every shot to maximise the points earned.Magnetic Billiards: Blueprint is completely FREE to play, and packed with great features:&bull; 20 graded 'Casual' tables to unlock, requiring skill and careful play to earn the highest grades.&bull; A 'Grand Score' which keeps track of the sum of your best ever scores on each table.&bull; A 'Grand Tally' which keeps track of the sum of all the points you've ever earned across every game played.&bull; Full Game Center support, including separate Leaderboards for both the iPhone / iPod touch and iPad versions.&bull; Dozens of Achievements to discover.&bull; Completely 'universal' app, with fast and responsive gameplay on both the iPhone / iPod touch and the iPad.&bull; Full HD graphics on iPad and Retina displays.Addition optional expansions can be purchased in-game, including new content and new game modes:&bull; Three Arcade Games - Relentless, Sardines and Countdown - ranging from stress-free relaxing gaming, to manic, fast-paced challenges.&bull; 20 graded 'Serious' tables, offering a deeper challenge for more advanced players.&bull; A one time only purchase of a 'Skeleton Key', unlocking all existing content and any future content, as well as allowing a short-cut to instantly unlock any table.\", \"genre\": [\"Puzzle\"], \"metascore\": \"81\", \"critic_reviews\": 8, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2011-07-16\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-199288-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-199288-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": \"Generally favorable\", \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Zee 3 Limited (Publisher)\", \"Zee 3 Limited (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Cranky Cat\", \"title_search\": \"cranky cat\", \"title_keyword\": \"cranky cat\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/cranky-cat/\", \"summary\": \"An absurdly fun puzzle game!
