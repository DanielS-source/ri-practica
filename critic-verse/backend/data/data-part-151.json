OBJECTIVE: During a single trading session, generate as much cash as possible by buying and selling 4 play stocks (A,B,C,D). Each trading session presents a unique scenario with random stock fluctuations. Each trading session begins with an initial amount of cash to buy stocks. As a player buys and sells stocks, the cash amount increases or decreases. During the trading session, an analyst makes recommendations and a broker confirms executed buy and sell orders (via 2 scrolling tickers). At the end of a trading session, the game score is the amount of cash generated.                                          SPLIT-SECOND MOVEMENT OF CASH: A single button tap moves cash instantly into a stock or out.  BURST PLAY: Each trading session is 2 1/2 minutes or less.    EASY VISUAL TRACKING: Each stock has a distinct color (A=purple, B=orange, C=green, D=yellow) allowing easy color matching with stock&#39;s:  &bull; chart graph  &bull; stock table entry  &bull; analyst&#39;s buy/sell/hold recommendations  &bull; broker&#39;s order confirmations &bull; buy &amp; sell buttons  TAP CONFIGURABLE BUTTONS: Buy button taps are configured to use some % of available cash to purchase shares. For example, a single-tap can be configured to use 25% of available cash, while a double-tap uses 50%, and a triple-tap uses %100. A player configures these taps as desired.  OTHER FEATURES: &bull; short selling enable &bull; replay enable &bull; top scores with buy/sell transaction records &bull; game pause, save and restore &bull; detailed help screen &bull; adjustable game speed &bull; stock exchange audio  HAPPY TRADING!!!  GLOBAL SCORES COMING SOON!!!  BUG FOUND in Version 1.0 - Version 1.0 : Any short sold stock orders left open at end of trading session cause a crash. The fix for this bug is in Version 1.1 which is available now. To avoid the bug in version 1.0, disable &#39;short selling&#39; in the game settings.
