Beneath the ancient burial mound, known locally as Barrow Hill, a forgotten myth awakes. Join the adventure, and uncover the secrets of the past. The legends of the Cornish world will live again; renewed, refreshed and hungry. Time has no meaning, as the sun sets low across the landscape. Stranded on the lonely road, which leads up to the Barrow, you must make your way through the trees, and darkening landscape, and out onto the Barrow itself. Following in the footsteps of the well-known archaeologist, Conrad Morse, you will discover that the barrow is more than just a mound of earth and a collection of forgotten standing stones. However, not all archaeology is constructive, for some things should be left buried and undisturbed. Perhaps it is too late for that...
