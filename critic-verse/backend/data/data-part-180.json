On his quest, the heroic young Prince finds a companion, 'Box Dog', who aids and accompanies him in his many quests. At the start of his adventure, Prince Pixel finds a magic wand that allows him to bring anything he draws to life. The wand also enables him to temporarily take the shape of any enemy encountered and learn their powers. Prince Pixel can become anything the player draws and transform between three additional different creatures at any given time. As Prince Pixel advances through the game, he gets stronger, tougher, and more skilled. Players also benefit from experience by acquiring more drawing tools and abilities. By the end of the game, players can literally re-create any creature that they've seen in the game with an incredibly easy-to-use drawing program. The game allows the user to draw straight lines as well, so even someone with no drawing skills whatsoever can create just about anything. Players use their imagination to battle their way through levels or creatively solve puzzles.

Use the stylus to power up different colored balls and directionally launch them at the same colored monsters on the top screen. Two single player modes - Scenario (choose your path through a total of 20 stages with multiple objectives in each) and Survival (eliminate as many monsters as possible). Use power-ups that affect the playfield, balls and monsters to gain temporary advantages. Avoid power-down items that can hinder your progress. Trigger chain attacks and explosions to destroy large numbers of monsters at once. Five different monsters in varying colors have different characteristics that affect how you can beat them. Avoid multiple obstacles like rotating walls and black holes. Local wireless play for up to 4 players. DS Download play - 4 players can play with just one Monster Bomber Game Card.

At stake: a mysterious artifact uncovered by a team of U.S. archeologists. The North Korean government quickly seizes the area, prompting the U.S. to dispatch an elite team of Delta Force operatives on a rescue mission. During the siege the true nature of the artifact quickly emerges, pointing to the existence of an alien presence on Earth, and ultimately the trigger for a massive-scale alien invasion. The battle to save Earth begins as the aliens' flash freeze the tropics into a ghostly-white frozen landscape. As gamers take up arms against the aliens, they will be outfitted with customizable weapons and a high tech Nanosuit, allowing them to adapt their tactics and abilities to a hostile, ever-changing environment and a mysterious enemy.

You can establish your club as the small team who receives loan players from a larger club or a large club looking for support getting your youngsters match experience by loaning them out. Have the first option on players from clubs, and schedule pre-arranged friendlies each season by simply asking your board for a feeder relationship and choose from the list they compile. Youth Revamp - A complete revamp of youth teams sees full youth squads for each team that has a youth set-up, thus giving a much better system for the regeneration of players in the long term game. Football Manager 2007 gives players a new easier to use default skin, along with hints and tips throughout the game, and an improved tutorial. In addition to better feedback from your assistant manager and scouts as well as lots more media, customisation and multiple row selection, all this adds up to the most user friendly Sports Interactive game ever. A complete revamp of the scouting system inside the game leads to more information about players and teams being made available to managers, as well as a more realistic methodology for player scouting. This system allows scouts to grow and improve their knowledge-base of the world's football players. You can now talk to any player in the world via the media. Player interaction allows you to tap up other teams stars or see if players will buckle under the pressure. An effective manager must use the media as a motivational tool - why not praise your own players in many different ways or shout at them for loss of form? For more varied ways to talk to your team, SI have worked hard to deliver vastly improved team talks at half and full time. Not only this, but pre-match team talks will now be making their first appearance in Football Manager - so you can send your team out onto the pitch with a specific briefing.
