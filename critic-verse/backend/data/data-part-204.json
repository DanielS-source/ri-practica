Its a Community Messaging Game. Each game is played on an island where two squads of up to four soldiers battle each other for supremacy. The player takes the role of a military officer, issuing strategic commandings to his / her squad, then watching the resulting battle unfold. Games are started by players sending out Challenges to anybody they know - either exisiting Naked War players in their in-game address book, or real life friends or acquiantences via their email address list. Each player takes it in turn to plan the movement of their four units. Each unit is allowed up to seven 'moves' per turn, and can move, attack, enter buildings, drive tanks and other vehicles or use items, etc., each move. Once the player has set up all the moves for their four units, he / she clicks the send button, which sends an email to their opponent containing this turn (in the form of an attached file), then plays back the turn on their PC, showing both players the results of the planned moves. When a player receives a turn in their email Inbox, they simply double click the attachment to launch Naked War, which plays back the turn received then allows the player to set up their own turn in reply. Each soldier in the game starts with a 'doofer', but looses it to their attacker if the damage inflicted is great enough to 'demob' the soldier, losing their uniform and making them naked! The aim of the game is for one team to defeat the other by gaining control of all the doofers, and the winner is declared at the end of the turn where the last doofer changes hands. Each turn is played offline at whatever time is convenient to the player. There is no need for both players to be on-line at the same time, or playing at the same time. Turns can be replied to instantly, during lunchtime, or at the end of the day, or they can wait in your Inbox for days until the you are ready to respond. The average turns take only a few minutes to set up and play back, and a game can take anything from as little as 10 turns, up to 50 or more before there is a winner, depending on the complexity of the map and the relative skill of the players involved.

It's all here.  Team and player ratings.  Realistic penalties.  Realistic turnovers.  Weather effects (play in a blizzard and see how it affects the game!) No more canned playbooks designed by someone else.  Design your offense on the fly, change your formation to fortify your call, or to completely mislead the defense.  Change your pass pattern to hit their gaps or to try for the sidelines.  Mix in screens and traps to slow their pass rush. On defense, adjust your formation and coverage to stop the offense.  Shift your defensive line to stop their runner or have them stunt for a better pass rush.  Key your opponent's best back or double-team his hot receiver.  Blitz one or more linebackers (you choose!) or a safety. On offense and defense, manage the clock like a pro coach. You'll have to overcome turnovers, weather, and referees, but your coaching decisions make the biggest impact. Of course, all your game stats are here - team, rushing, passing, receiving, total yards, time of possession, third downs converted, you name it. And you want to scout your rival?
