To get started, you'll line yourself up for a photo - positioning your head and hands as instructed so that your body can become your means to control the madness. You can choose from four game modes to play, each mode featuring five different challenges and hosted by different characters. Whichever mode you opt to play, the fact that it reflects the personality of your host is a guarantee that things will get crazy! In Wario's challenges, you'll have to make big movements with your face and body to succeed - perhaps collecting coins or shaking your head at high speed to dry off a dog! Mona\\u2019s mini-games, on the other hand, will require you to line yourself up with targets on the screen. You might have to move your head into place to catch a falling hat or squash a fly just by clapping your hands. In Jimmy\\u2019s challenges, you'll play peek-a-boo with a baby, stick fingers up nostrils and dish out a quick massage just by performing the right actions. The remaining set of mini-games are hosted by ninja twins, Kat and Ana. This duo know the value of good friends, which means all their challenges require you to have a sidekick handy. Line your faces up in a totem pole, smash through a stone block together and figure out the right formations to get through whatever comes your way.

They formed a new nation called Konkordia and then increased the population through cloning their people. Konkordia has already conquered more than 30 planets and has become a powerful star nation. While The United Earth Empire has signed peace with Konkordia there was always tension in the relations between the two states. The Tomorrow War is a space sim based on the trilogy of novels written by a famous Russian author, Alexander Zorich. These books are dedicated to the intergalactic war of two mighty empires. Along with the graduates of the military-space academy players will witness different stages of the conflict between United Earth Empire and Konkordia.
