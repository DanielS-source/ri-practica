It&#39;s easy to play but quite challenging. ---- the match 3 game to get (Denmeister) Just dont play this near your girlfriend, she&#39;ll ask to play it and not give it back lolz. ---- Addicting (JonasQuinn) The game becomes very challenging after some time. But, it&#39;s also addicting, you just keep playing and playing and cannot stop. ----  *** NOTE ***  Please notice this game is DESIGNED FOR USING 2 THUMBS / FINGERS TO PLAY. If a player just use only 1 thumb / finger, he will lose control definitely. (Only when you are trying to be a SUPER CLASS player, you can use only 1 finger to challenge yourself. In that case, maybe you can try to play Minigore using 1 finger only, too.)  We do such design since we want it to become a ACTIVE &amp; EXCITING game, more ACTION feature within.  1 FINGER CONTROL can NOT manage the action of &#34;Interchange &amp; Target column position&#34; well, otherwise MISTAKE or CONFUSION will happen when YOU JUST WANNA CHANGE COLUMN BUT NOT INTERCHANGE THEM or YOU WANNA CHANGE COLUMN &amp; INTERCHANGE THEM IN THE SAME TIME.  Try it using 2 thumbs of 2 hands, DECIDE TARGET COLUMN &amp; SEQUENCE BEFORE IT DROPS, you will be so excited and having much fun with HIGH SCORES.   -----------------------------------------  Please do NOT hesitate to email us here if you have any question or suggestion: toropot.game@gmail.com  RELEASES  Ver 1.3: Globefish Attack!!!

Fearing one day evil would return he sealed what is most precious in The Great Library of the Kings.  Only the King alone could ever open the doors to The Great Library, so he gave his life and split his soul into seven different pieces.     As many years passed, the seven spirits became weakened. The great spirits became corrupt and conjured evil once more into the world.   Never had such evil prevailed upon the land. The great spirits had become nearly unstoppable.
