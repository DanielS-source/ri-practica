San Francisco is under attack from an invasion of alien ships and UFOs! It&rsquo;s up to you and your trusty WWII Corsair single prop fighter plane to save the city! Will you have what it takes to take on the X Invasion?  X Invasion&rsquo;s realistic free roaming 3D technology means you are free to decide how your adventure unfolds. Blasting everything in sight is great stress relief! Or test your accuracy as a sniper. Or simply enjoy a relaxing flight over the beautiful San Francisco Bay Area.  X Invasion includes two modes of play: Career Mode and Timed Mode. In Career Mode, accumulate medals of honor through multi-level play as you progress in experience all the way to the prestigious Top Gun ranking. In Timed Mode, blast your way to infamy on X Invasion&rsquo;s real-time high scores list.    UNIQUE GAMEPLAY  X Invasion is not an ultra-realistic flight simulator with complex controls that take hours of frustration to master. Instead, X Invasion is a fun fast-paced retro-style shoot-em up.   Remember the side scrollers and top-down shooters from the arcades? They weren&#39;t hard to learn, but they were insanely  fun because you could pound frantically on the fire button to destroy everything in sight.  X Invasion takes this simple concept but extends it with true free roaming 3D graphics!   MAIN FEATURES  Advance through over 100 levels of play on your way to becoming a Top Gun in Career Mode, or experience the intensity of Timed Mode play!  Fly over geographically accurate views of the San Francisco Bay Area in a true 3D free roaming environment!  Fly over and around real landmarks, streets and scenery. Ever want to land ON the Golden Gate Bridge? Ever want to fly over downtown San Francisco at 1000 MPH? You can with X Invasion!  Take on various alien ships, from speedy scout ships flying in formation to spinning UFOs with glowing lights to gigantic motherships that take on real damage!  Compare your fighting ability with other pilots who have taken on the X Invasion.  Will you be the first to reach the status of Top Gun, or will you choose to have the highest accuracy rating? Your success will be displayed for all in a fully integrated real-time scores list.  Simple and intuitive controls. Tilt and rotate the device to move, slide your finger up/down on the right side of the screen to control your speed, tap anywhere on the screen to shoot. Spend more time playing, not learning difficult controls!  WHAT&#39;S NEW  We listened to your comments and made this version of X Invasion better than ever.  Watch out, the aliens shoot back at you now!  But if your health is getting low, enemies will leave behind POWER-UPs when they are destroyed for you to boost your health.  New and updated high score list means you can challenge your friends from across the room, or across the world! *Unfortunately, because of change in gameplay, version 1.0 Career Mode high scores cannot be transferred to this version.

I think TipCat Games clinched Cell War with this; both casual and hardcore players will be satisfied with what the game has to offer.            On the easy level, there were noticeably less enemies, they fired slower, and there was never more than one semi-boss or boss on the screen at one time. On the hard difficulty, the screen began to become swarmed with easily killed but annoying enemies, and sometimes there was even more than one semi-boss on screen. In addition, there are quite a few levels and numerous bosses.

Laren was sent to investigate the temple by the village elders after Undead monsters started to appear on the outskirts of town. The temple has been in the forest at the edge of town for as long as anyone can remember. No one has been inside it, or for that matter anywhere close to it, for generations.  Legends of the evils here still frighten the children of the village.  However when Laren was asked by the elders to go to the temple to investigate as the town protector he had to go. In fact he was happy to go as he saw this as his chance to once and for all dispel the myth surrounding the temple.  Not expecting to find any evil there he did not take much gear with him, just the usual hunting items. Little did he know what he was getting himself into.  As such the story of Laren starts. How will you guide him in the depths of the temple? Will you be able to save his life and that of his fellow villagers?  Or will you remain lost in the dungeons, doomed to wander aimlessly until you die...  Are you ready for Temple of Arkadoom: Laren&#39;s Quest?  Featuring 3D graphics and great depth of play, enjoy this dungeon crawling game. Play either through the story or just generate random dungeons of any type you like.

Electric Box is sure to keep you occupied for hours... with new levels posted all the time!  ============================ Press Reviews: ============================  &#34;Electric Box is a clever puzzle game with a great interface.&#34; - IGN.com &#34;I&#39;ve been having a great time with Electric Box, and could easily see myself playing through all the included levels.&#34; - Toucharcade.com &#34;A new, creative puzzle game has surfaced, and it rocks: A little gem from Candystand that&#39;s called Electric Box.&#34; - Jayisgames.com  ============================ About Electric Box: ============================  Candystand.com&#39;s most popular electric puzzler is now on the iPhone! Recently featured in the New and Noteworthy section of the iTunes store, Electric Box is making a spark, picking up steam, and creating a buzz.  The goal of the game is simple: there is a power source and a target that lacks power. Use the tools in the game to get the power from the source to the target.  Easy, right?   Well... what if the tools include items like tea kettles, laser beams, refrigerators &amp; light bulbs? Sounding less easy? What if I told you there were 60 (SIXTY!) levels to puzzle your way through? While the mechanics are so simple that you can pick the game up and start playing right away, the game is deep enough to stay challenging for hours. And if you&#39;re already familiar with the online version, you&#39;ll be glad to know that this version has dozens of new levels you&#39;ve never seen before.  This is one of the most original and highly-praised puzzlers ever launched online, and its iPhone debut doesn&#39;t disappoint. It&#39;s clean, clear, and fun, and it&#39;s so smooth you&#39;ll think Electric Box was designed for the phone in the first place.   Love Geared?  Love The Incredible Machine?  Crazy Machines?  Tangram puzzles?  Any old puzzle?  Eating?  Breathing?  Then this is the game for you.  Jayisgames.com liked it so much they even wrote their review in song:   The levels of Electric Box are built to test your mettle;  One stage, you might reroute the steam of an electric kettle.  Another might use mirrors to shine red lasers here and there,  And if you&#39;re not prepared, you&#39;ll end up tearing out your hair.  Electric Box is quite a pleasant sight;  Its chain-reaction gameplay makes me want to play all night.  The sounds and music are spot-on, and really suit the mood;  The graphics, too, are lovely fits, if I may so conclude.    -SonicLover from Jayisgames.com    ============================ More praise from the masses: ============================   - &#34;This is one of the best puzzlers in the App store and one of my favorite games of all time.
