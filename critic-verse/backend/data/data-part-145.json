(Forgive the unintentional pun.)&#34; - Tom Vasel, Boardgame Reviewer  From the mind of award-winning designer Dr. Reiner Knizia comes this simple and addictive card game!  It&rsquo;s an exciting battle of skill, luck, and nerves in Reiner Knizia&rsquo;s Poison. As potion-makers brewing magic elixirs, players play numbered Potion cards into one of three, colored cauldrons, being careful not to overfill them. The player who overfills the cauldron must take all of the cards that go with it, including any of the deadly Poison cards that were mixed in! Players with either the most or least of a Potion at the end of the game might just have a chance of surviving the potions lab and winning the game.  PEOPLE ARE SAYING  &#34;All in all, I think that Reiner Knizia&rsquo;s Poison is an excellent iPhone game. It is the right level of challenge that I want from my iPhone: something that is interesting, plays quickly, but can be put down easily if more pressing matters come up. The value you get for the low price of $2.99 makes this a worthwhile purchase. I highly recommend it for both German game fans and iPhone game enthusiasts.&#34; - Boardgamegeek.com review  GAME FEATURES  - Play against the computer in 4, 5, and 6 player games - Challenging AI enhances replayability - Atmospheric music and sound effects\", \"genre\": [\"Board\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-03-13\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116384-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116384-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Griptonite Games (Developer)\", \"Griptonite Games (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"1945 Ace Destroyer\", \"title_search\": \"1945 ace destroyer\", \"title_keyword\": \"1945 ace destroyer\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/1945-ace-destroyer/\", \"summary\": \"---------------------------------------------------  ALL-IN-1 GAMEBOX is at $0.99 limited time special promotion now.  12 highly ranked games in 1 App, including this game (full version)!

Well now you can, with hoverpoker!  You don&#39;t need to have an app each, just one phone is enough. The app will deal cards to each player, and you pass your phone around to each player to let them see their card and take action (call, raise, fold). To peek your card, touch both peek buttons on the screen.  They won&#39;t be able to peek at your cards, because it makes a sound when you try to peek the card, and there&#39;s a counter indicating how many times you have peeked the cards. Also, all players will not miss out because the app also acts as a poker dealer, announcing actions taken by players with a voice (call, raise, fold, how much $ raised etc).  You can play with up to 22 players, which is probably more than any poker game 99.99% of you ever had. All with one device!  Texas holdem rule used in this app : no-limit holdem. Blinds can be changed each round. You can undo rounds, and exiting will save the table state, so you can interrupt your game anytime.
