Be ready to get into the game for hours!   - Rules  The rules are very simple. Paint a block with 5 colors: red, yellow, green, blue, and purple, then match 5 blocks of the same color to erase them. That&#39;s it! Paint your favorite color and erase blocks!   - Once you get used to the game control...  The more chain reactions your make, the more points your get. Trigger chain reactions to aim for a high score.  When the star is blinking, you can use the star paint. The star paint allows you to paint all the blocks that are same color as the selected color in a new color. So it&#39;s a chance to erase blocks in bulk!   - About modes  Story mode Play the game along with the story of little Pickle the painter.  Pickle paints various paintings on each stage. If you can clear all the stages, you may get some more fun!  Challenge mode This is a score attack mode where you have to concentrate on erasing blocks. Register your high score on the rankings and compete against other players in the world!  Extra mode This mode is for people who can&#39;t get enough of the challenge mode. Keep playing until the time is up. You can also play the score attack and register your score in the rankings in this mode.  Puzzle mode Erase blocks following to the given conditions. Colors and the number of times that you can use are limited. Use your brain and solve the puzzles carefully.  Ranking Compete with other players and compare scores.  -Tips to get a high score  Watch out when the level is going up if you are aiming the high score. The level won&#39;t go up when the chain reaction is happening while the LAST field shows 0. This means you can erase more blocks and get more points. When the level goes up, the remaining time will be added to the score as a bonus. It is important to leave the time limit as high as possible when going to the next level.

Technobrains? Thumpies delivers some intense fun that will keep you coming back again and again.  Toucharcade? - Thumpies is an amazingly creative game, and thanks to the multiple difficulty levels should be approachable enough for kids and challenging enough for adults.

Touchreviews? ...he whole game looks great with the just a position of the monsters and the butterflies being pulled off perfectly to create a musical game that will be loved by young and old a like.  AppSpy? Thumpies is a fresh breath of air in the rhythm genre, that should appeal to all ages.The game is in a league of is own.   ?Thumpies is a unique rhythm based music game for players of all ages. By correctly matching the beat of bouncing Thumpies, the player progresses through a song. If the player hits the targets in time, their Thump&rsquo;o&rsquo;meter slowly rises, but if the player misses or hits out of time, the meter falls. Unlike typical rhythm based games, Thumpies uses a mechanic of bouncing in time instead of just a series of notes. One way to describe Thumpies is a rhythm game crossed with juggling.  ?The quirky art design of Thumpies is accompanied by a unique musical score composed by award winning industry veteran David Kerr. The music was crafted with game play in mind giving the player a harmonizing experience. Players also have the chance to unlock progressively bizarre Thumpies by collecting different colored butterflies, that&rsquo;s if the hungry Thumpies don&rsquo;t eat them up on you first. Thumpies is a game that will keep people of all ages hooked with its addictive, quirky and stylistic gameplay.
