Once the groups are made the cards are replaced by new ones and points/life earned.  How to play: The are 5 cards open. Flip the cards you want to replace by touching on them and on the button &#39;Deal&#39;. The more you flip the more life you lose. Once you life is over the game ends.  Hints:  There are numbers on the cards. Keep the large ones because they score more. There is a bonus meter. It is divided into the 4 groups you can make. You get more life when the bonus meter rises. Raise it by keep making the same kind of groups. E.g: 2 pairs over and over. If a different group is done it will start from the beginning. When a card flicker, group it and get extra points.   Bet Mania mode: This is a completely new kind of gaming. It is made for the bet lovers. The rules are very simple. A card with a number is shown. You bet a percentage of your points whether the next card number will be greater, smaller or equal. You can bet from 10% to 100% of your points.

(Forgive the unintentional pun.)&#34; - Tom Vasel, Boardgame Reviewer  From the mind of award-winning designer Dr. Reiner Knizia comes this simple and addictive card game!  It&rsquo;s an exciting battle of skill, luck, and nerves in Reiner Knizia&rsquo;s Poison. As potion-makers brewing magic elixirs, players play numbered Potion cards into one of three, colored cauldrons, being careful not to overfill them. The player who overfills the cauldron must take all of the cards that go with it, including any of the deadly Poison cards that were mixed in! Players with either the most or least of a Potion at the end of the game might just have a chance of surviving the potions lab and winning the game.  PEOPLE ARE SAYING  &#34;All in all, I think that Reiner Knizia&rsquo;s Poison is an excellent iPhone game. It is the right level of challenge that I want from my iPhone: something that is interesting, plays quickly, but can be put down easily if more pressing matters come up. The value you get for the low price of $2.99 makes this a worthwhile purchase.

Activities include quickly solving simple math problems, counting people going in and out of a house simultaneously, drawing pictures on the Touch Screen, reading classic literature out loud, and more. You can also play sudoku, the number puzzle game which has become an extremely popular feature in U.S. newspapers.

In Culdcept SAGA, individuals known as Cepters move around a game board by the roll of the dice, using magical cards to call upon creatures and cast spells to occupy each area they encounter. Using alluring cards designed by Japan's top illustrators, players can customize different decks to assist in their struggle for territorial dominance. As they maneuver their way around the board and land on occupied properties, opponents can opt to pay a fee for their brief stay or attack the guarding creature to inhabit the zone. Players can fortify their decks and develop strategies in single player mode, then apply those tactics against up to 3 friends on Xbox Live or on a single console. Gamers can further modify the game with their own unique style when they alter their characters' appearances using parts won during matches, providing a distinctive experience for every personality.
