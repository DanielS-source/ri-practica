As commander of the Starship U.S.S. Protector MCC-1700 X, your job is to wipe out the Krygon invasion fleet and make the galaxy safe for democracy. Your battleground is the entire galaxy, which is divided up into eight rows of eight quadrants each, like a checkerboard.  Rows are numbered from top to bottom, and columns are numbered left to right, so quadrant 1,8 would be in the upper right hand corner of the galaxy.  During battle you will be concerned only with those enemies that occupy the same quadrant as yourself.  Quadrants are divided up into sectors: eight rows of eight sectors each. Sectors are numbered in the same way as quadrants, so the sector in the upper right corner is sector 1,8.  You have a short-range scanner which allows you to look at the entire quadrant in a single display.  Trek Quest is a rich game, full of detail. If you are new to the game, just get a rough idea of the kinds of commands available, and start playing.  After a game or two you will have learned everything important.  You have weapons: phasers and photon torpedoes. You have a defense: deflector shields.  You can look at things: long-range scanners, short-range scanners, and a star chart.  You can move about, under warp drive or impulse power, orbit planets, mine for dilithium, dock at a star base and rest while repairs are being made...  see for yourself, the Krygons are waiting for You!  History: The game idea is based on the popular command line game &#34;Super Star Trek&#34; from the 1970s.  At that time computers did not have fancy graphical user interfaces but only teletype terminals. Still engineers liked to play games and because games were not  readily available they wrote their own ones. Star Trek has originally been written in FORTRAN, then in BASIC (published in the book &#34;BASIC computer games&#34;, by David Ahl) and got ported onto various personal computer systems like the Apple II. The author of TREK QUEST has once ported &#34;Super Star Trek&#34; onto the Sharp MZ-80K.  1996 Chris Nystrom rewrote the game using the C language which made it possible to run Super Star Trek on even more computer systems. There are many versions of Star Trek around because virtually every programmer who touched it also changed the game. TREK QUEST is based on the ideas of both Star Trek and Super Star Trek written by David Matuszek, Paul Reynolds, Don Smith and Tom Almy.  When we first thought about porting the game to the iPhone it was clear that the teletype  based user interface of the original game had to be replaced by something more appropriate to the iPhone platform.  We moved away from the teletype interface to a graphical,  modern theme, seen in many Science Fiction movies.
