For reasons unknown, however, the citizens of this advanced culture suddenly abandoned their technology, leaving the future of the human race to live in a comparatively primitive state. All that remained of this once great civilization were some scattered mechanical parts and the occasional remnants of a legendary golem -- huge mechanical devices built to serve mankind. While use of the old technology remained mostly out of reach, there were some who had begun to research the ancient devices, seeking even the faintest hope of enriching their lives on this desolate world. The situation changed dramatically about a hundred years ago when a new race known as the Veruni arrived on the planet. Although similar in appearance to humans, the Veruni's superior physical attributes and advanced technology allowed them to quickly establish dominance over mankind. The human race found itself relegated to second-class status, and many citizens were forced to perform hard labor day in and day out in order to survive. Fast-forward to the present day. In a small town called Capo Bronco on the outskirts of Filgaia, two youths, Dean Stark and Rebecca Streisand, witness an unbelievable event -- the giant arm of a golem somehow falling from the sky. Their disbelief grows further when they discover that within the clenched fist of the golem's hand lies a girl with little recollection of her past other than her name -- \\\"Avril.\\\" This chance encounter inspires Dean and Rebecca to travel with Avril across the wastelands of Filgaia in hopes of helping her regain her lost memories. Little do they know their journey will eventually decide the fate of all mankind.

\"https://www.metacritic.com/game/x-plane-helicopter/\", \"summary\": \"First, a quick note: Most of the negative reviews seem to come from people that do not READ the instructions, despite them being displayed every time the app is launched... so be sure to read the instructions! They are only about 4 sentences. Here&#39;s what you need to know:  -&gt;The throttle is automatically controlled for you.  -&gt;You drag the collective DOWN to INCREASE pitch... a situation that is ergonomically the same as real helos. REMEMBER: IN THE REAL HELO, YOU PULL THE COLLECTIVE HANDLE &gt;TOWARDS&lt;YOU TO INCREASE COLLECTIVE. ON X-PLANE FOR IPHONE, YOU DRAG YOUR THUMB &gt;TOWARDS&lt; YOU TO INCREASE COLLECTIVE, A SITUATION WITH THE CLOSEST ERGONOMIC SIMILARITY TO THE REAL MACHINE! This does mean that you drag the little slider TOWARDS you, or DOWN, to INCREASE collective.  And now, on with the show! X-Plane Helicopter is a new version of X-Plane that lets you realistically fly Helicopters!  You get some very interesting birds to fly, including:  The Robinson R-22: The lightweight, efficient trainer. The Bell-206: The turbine-powered mainstay of the helicopter fleet. The BlackHawk: The massive military cargo and troop mover. The Sea King: The huge land/sea rescue helicopter.  These fascinating and varied machines are modeled very realistically, so the flight you get on the iPhone is actually almost as realistic as the full FAA-Certified flight-model used in X-Plane for desktop... You get almost all the flight-model realism of this certified sim: On your phone.  As well, the flight-area is the Grand Canyon, giving you amazing views as you fly your helos across (and into!) the various canyons and valleys, giving the most visually-stunning simulation we have yet released, with the most challenging and realistic flight-models we have produced for iPhone so far.  Now, a quick lesson: The COLLECTIVE control is on the LEFT of the iPhone screen... drag it DOWN GENTLY to INCREASE the pitch of the main rotor, thus causing the helo to lift. As you drag this collective down, you will notice that the throttle AUTOMATICALLY increases on the right side of the screen. This is because the throttle governor automatically increases the engine power to maintain the desired rotor RPM as you increase the load on the rotor by increasing the rotor pitch. This is how the real helicopters work, and how we simulate them on the iPhone.  The tail-rotor is controlled for you automatically, since your iPhone does not have any anti-torque pedals plugged into it. ;-)  If you are ready for the best scenery and most fascinating and challenging flight model available on the iPhone, then you are ready for X-Plane-Helicopter.\", \"genre\": [\"Aircraft Sim\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2008-12-11\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116132-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116132-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Laminar Research (Publisher)\", \"Laminar Research (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"My Animal Shelter\", \"title_search\": \"my animal shelter\", \"title_keyword\": \"my animal shelter\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/my-animal-shelter/\", \"summary\": null, \"genre\": [\"Virtual Career\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": null, \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-86604-13.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/3/6-1-86604-13.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": null, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"Europe\"], \"companies\": [\"bhv Software (Publisher)\", \"bhv Software (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Air Assault Task Force\", \"title_search\": \"air assault task force\", \"title_keyword\": \"air assault task force\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/air-assault-task-force/\", \"summary\": \"Air Assault Task Force places you in the boots and saddles of the air cavalry, commanding forces across decades of helicopter operations.\", \"genre\": [\"Aircraft Sim\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": null, \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-86665-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-86665-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Football Genius - The Ultimate Quiz\", \"title_search\": \"football genius  the ultimate quiz\", \"title_keyword\": \"football genius  the ultimate quiz\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/football-genius-the-ultimate-quiz/\", \"summary\": \"[Xbox Live Arcade]  Are you a Football Genius?
