This means players will have to not only jump around but drop to the floor to slap arrows with their hands. Another major difference between IN THE GROOVE and DDR is the arrows. Here, they are fully polygonal, meaning the arrows can spin around, bounce up and down, look like they&Atilde;&cent;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;&iuml;&iquest;&frac12;re vanishing into the background, and other tricks that challenge the player.

The game play modes include all of the standard ones gamers have come to expect in a dancing game: arcade mode, two-player challenge mode, workout mode, and never-ending modes are all available for players to enjoy.

Price Drop! 0,99 few days only !!! A new exciting and extending game: Wild West Checkers. Events in the game take us back in the days of the conquest of the Wild West and fight American settlers from the warlike Indian tribes. The bloody war lasted more than 100 years. Violent clashes took place with varying success and claimed tens of thousands of lives on both sides. According to estimates the U.S. Census Bureau between 1775 and 1890 occurred more than 40 wars, that killed 45,000 Indians and 19,000 Whites.  Wild West Checkers offers a peaceful way to resolve conflicts. And who knows, if it had been invented before, perhaps it would have saved thousands of lives!   Rules of the game are diabolically simple. Shoot enemy checkers from the game field while ensuring that as many of yours stay on as possible. If yours is the last man standing, you win. You&rsquo;ll need a keen eye and strong hand to be the victor in this app but more than that, you need clever strategy. Each player gets 8 checkers to start, which are placed on opposite ends of the game field. Go ahead and use your finger to pull back your checker, then let go to shoot toward your opponent&rsquo;s game piece. Little arrows indicate the direction and stroke power of your shot. The player with at least one checker left on the game field wins the battle.  The war is not over with the first battle, though. A second battle starts with the first game&rsquo;s loser playing with one less checker. Does that ensure that you&rsquo;ll win this round? No. If your opponent has found an excellent strategy, you may find it challenging to overthrow him in the second game. All is fair in love and war and that includes Wild West Checkers. You never know who is going to win. If you want to give yourself a game playing advantage, fine tune your skills and hone your moves by playing against the app initially. After you&rsquo;ve developed your game playing skills, invite a partner to join you in a war game. If you&rsquo;ve practiced and perfected your game, you&rsquo;re bound to win more than you lose.  Just to keep things interesting, there are three levels of complexity: * Easy level &mdash; the arrow showing the direction and the force of strike has depicted * Medium level &mdash; just the arrow showing the direction of strike has depicted * High level &mdash; the arrow hasn&rsquo;t been depicted at all  So, who will you be, the American settler struggling for a place under the sun at least one checker left on the game field, or the American Indian defending their ancestral lands? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out. Better grab the Wild West Checkers app now so you can start practicing.\", \"genre\": [\"Board\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-03-16\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-148597-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-148597-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"MaxNick (Publisher)\", \"MaxNick (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Marble Solitaire\", \"title_search\": \"marble solitaire\", \"title_keyword\": \"marble solitaire\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/marble-solitaire/\", \"summary\": \"The goal of this classic Marble Solitaire strategy game is to remove as many marbles as possible, by &#34;jumping&#34; one marble over another, either horizontally or vertically. 7 levels available.

Racers can exceed speeds of 130 kilometers per hour (80 mph) and require considerable strength and technical expertise.  Water or salt are often spread throughout the course to ensure that it gets icy, which inhibits dangerous rutting of the course, but also increases speed. The course is designed to challenge the best skiers in a variety of tasks: skiing at high speeds over ice, through difficult turns, extreme steeps, flats, and huge airs (jumps).  Bobsled Teams make timed runs down narrow, twisting, banked, iced tracks in a gravity-powered sled. Modern tracks are made of concrete and artificial ice. They are required to have at least one straight and one labyrinth. Ideally, a modern track should be 1200 to 1300 meters long and have at least fifteen curves. Speeds may exceed 130 km/h, and some curves can subject the crews to as much as 5 g. Luge and Skeleton events have only 1 or 2 person sleds.  Ski Jump Is divided into four separate sections; 1) In-run, 2) Take-off (jump), 3) Flight and 4) Landing. In each part the athlete is required to pay attention to and practice a particular technique in order to maximize the outcome of ultimate length and style marks.  Aerodynamics has become a factor of increasing importance in modern ski jumping, with recent rules addressing the regulation of ski jumping suits.   Snowboard There are snowboard slalom events and halfpipe events.  Halfpipe scoring is judge based and rated on jump height, rotations, and technique.  *High resolution OpenGL 3D graphics *Realistic sound effects *Dozens of different slopes and tracks *Online high score database *Select from every single competing country  More events will come with each update!\", \"genre\": [\"Athletics\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-02-20\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-145826-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-145826-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Sea Venture LLC (Developer)\", \"Sea Venture LLC (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Lost in Reefs\", \"title_search\": \"lost in reefs\", \"title_keyword\": \"lost in reefs\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/lost-in-reefs/\", \"summary\": \"The recent discovery of ancient scrolls leads to an amazing realization: a lost civilization of people and dragons.
