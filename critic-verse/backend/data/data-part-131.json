You can see the frozen fish ice cubes; defrost them by breaking the ice!  Gameplay: Break the ice of each fish group, by holding the pen down on the screen and moving it on each fish without letting go. The ice will break and the fish will appear. After a while the pairs will be calculated and the points &amp; life earned.   Meters: When the temperature meter on the left: 1) Empties: You lose. 2) Fills: Level Up!  You can fill the combo meter and gain more life only if additional pairs are made without any tapping just after pairs are done.   There are three different modes: EASY, HARD and MEMORY mode.  HARD MODE: 1) You lose life every second. 2) If defrost fish are not made pairs fast after a while they freeze and then become ice cubes as it was before.  3) It is a lot more difficult.  MEMORY MODE: There are 12 different pairs of fish which are hidden. You can see 2 fish of your choice at a time. The idea is to find the pairs.  Pair bonus: This item gives you life bonus, multiplied by the pairs of fish you have found at that time.

(And destroy it when it displeases you...)  Oddly hypnotic and relaxing, Artificial Life is a simulation of the growth and evolution of microorganisms - basically artificial life forms.  Initially, each organism is given a random set of rules governing its behavior.  If the rules end up being useful for survival, the organism may live long enough to mate with another organism and pass its genetic code on to some offspring.     Over time, the organisms with the most useful behaviors will pass on their genetic code, leading to interesting patterns of behavior unfolding before your eyes - flocking behaviors, solitary predatory tactics, scavenging, and hiding are  some examples - and all this behavior is evolving from total randomness.    Pan and zoom using using touch and pinch gestures to explore this virtual world.  You have control over 10 attributes of the world allowing for much experimentation with this simulation.    You can also edit the individual chromosomes that define the behavior of any particular protozoa.   And, if you don&#39;t like how some of the organisms are behaving, you can always resort to the finger of death and destroy that which displeases you.    Queue up some music with your iPod app and then launch this app for some relaxing times in the microscopic world of Artificial Life.  You can read more about the app and view a video demonstration at: www.stormyprods.com/alife  Thank you all for the feedback!   It is appreciated.  As time and practicality permits, more suggestions will be incorporated into newer updates.  You&#39;ve all suggested lots of great ideas!  TIP: If you would prefer to see fairly rapid population explosions, you can achieve this by adjusting the protozoa&#39;s &#34;Max Energy&#34; setting. Choosing a value of 100, rather than the default 200 will achieve the desired effect. Protozoa will be able to reproduce at twice the normal rate, although any one protozoa will have half the normal life span if it does not eat anything and will get hungry at twice the default rate.\", \"genre\": [\"Simulation\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-05-21\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116723-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-116723-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Stormy Productions (Developer)\", \"Stormy Productions (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Disaster Report 4: Summer Memories\", \"title_search\": \"disaster report 4 summer memories\", \"title_keyword\": \"disaster report 4 summer memories\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/disaster-report-4-summer-memories/\", \"summary\": \"Through the game, players can experience the fear brought on by an earthquake, and can learn that wisdom, bravery and people's bonding through mutual assistance are necessary for survival.

Plots are being hatched and people are dying in the highest spheres of power. All the kings have lost a princess to give some work to the knights, but evil is everywhere and the world can tip into chaos at any moment.

OK, a magician of the calibre of Glandalf isn&#39;t even capable of lighting a fire, but when one of his friends is in danger he is ready to do anything to save him.

He is working in Transylvania for Count Dracula, himself! However, the count is an &#34;ungrateful gaffer&#34; and Butcho is being exploited to the full. This is too much for Glandalf and he decides that he will go help his friend find a more stable and better paid job!  Glandalf may have delusions of grandeur, but he does know that he cannot defeat Dracula by himself. He therefore thinks of Luigi the thief, the third member of his merry little band. And what a finely-tuned band it is! A big thick executioner to take the hits, a thief to pick the locks, a magician to inflict damage and a . . . . ummmh . . .Well, normally there would be a priest to heal the injured, but it would seem that Glandalf never made it to the end of the dungeon exploration manual !
