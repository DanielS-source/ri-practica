Hopefully you have enough brain power to grade the answers from your students! Kids say the funniest things and it is up to you to catch what is right and what is wrong. Give students A's or F's based on their answers. Careful, not all of them are geniuses so it is up to you to catch the wrong answers!  Students will try to be funny and outwit you with your answers. It may be funny, but it will still be wrong! Fail that kid! We don't appreciate their attempts to be comedians. Make sure they know math, English, or geography. Some of the answers might even have you feeling like a smart, brainy professor.
