As a result, these are no &ldquo;pea-brained&rdquo; dinosaurs &ndash; these are dangerous creatures that are able to see, hear and sense the hunter.  If you&rsquo;re not careful, it&rsquo;s very easy for the hunter to become the hunted.  With 15 different dinosaurs across 5 distinct environments including pine forests, muddy marshes and rolling hills, how you approach your target is important.  Wind direction, scent and the use of a special dinosaur call are all key elements in tracking your prey.   Game Features: &bull; 3D dinosaurs, from the Herbivorous (plant eating) for novice hunters to the Carnivorous (meat-eating) for experts; &bull; Choose from among six different weapon types &ndash; from a sniper rifle to an X-bow; &bull; Utilize the map and radar feature to locate and track dinosaurs; &bull; 2 exciting game modes: - Hunting: a non-linear hunting experience where players roam through vast landscapes, tracking and hunting a variety of dinosaurs; - Survival: a timed, frenzied affair where dinosaurs begin rushing the player in an attempt to eat him.  The pace starts slowly and builds, and the person who can stay alive the longest is the winner; &bull; Online leader boards and social networking integration; &bull; Interactive Dino Trophy Room.
