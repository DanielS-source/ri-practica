Your mission is to lead the &#34;white dot&#34; the fastest you can through the obstacles that show up in Pongland. On your way you will find many obstacles: dumb and smart paddles, invisible bars, moving platforms, attractive and repulsive items, sliding doors, stretching figures, puzzles, labyrinths, dungeons and so on. The laws of gravity and motion can change anywhere, anytime. It&#39;s your ability to discover the tricks on the way and avoid them as well as catching the bonuses. You are given a limited amount of time to complete each level. The fastest you overcome the obstacles the highest your score gets.\\r \\r ----  CONTROLS ---- \\r \\r Sliding your finger on the screen will influence the dot&#39;s speed and direction. Longer the slide stronger the acceleration applied. Keep touching the screen and you will apply the acceleration continuously. Your ability to influence movement can be limited on a screen by screen basis. Sometimes you can influence movement vertically or horizontally only. Check the HUD (Head Up Display) for the available modes. For faster accelerations you can use the turbo mode: slide with two fingers.
