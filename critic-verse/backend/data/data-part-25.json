It resulted from an infamous misunderstanding between Lords Raglan and Lucan, and saw Lord Cardigan leading the Light Brigade on an advance up a valley toward a Russian gun battery. The valley was lined on both sides by Russian guns and soldiers - and the causalties were horrendous. Of the 673 men who began the charge, only 195 were fit for action at its end. Although the charge was successful, not for nothing did Tennyson describe it as \\\"The Valley of Death\\\" in his classic poem. The Game This battle simulation recreates the Battle of Balaclava, during which the Charge took place. The game provides your chance to play all four major sectors of this epic battle - The Thin Red Line, The Charge of The Heavy Brigade, The Charge of the Light Brigade, and The Battle for the Redoubts. Plan your strategy to use your smaller British, French and Turkish forces to defend against the larger Russian enemy... or play the Russians on the attack! The System The Charge of the Light Brigade uses a much-enhanced version of Impressions' highly acclaimed miniature-style system (as used in Rorke's Drift and Cohort). Extremely popular, the system features beautifully animated figures, and lets you control each army unit (as shown on-screen by a soldier) individually - so you can watch the unit march off to obey your commands! There are also very powerful group commands, so that you can order groups of soldiers into action at once - for example to send a Regiment of cavalry charging towards the enemy. The system is very easy to use, being entirely mouse - and icon-controlled, allowing you to enjoy the game without getting bogged down with complex commands. The system has been improved from suggestions received from many happy Cohort and Rorke's Drift users.

Throughout each stage, random trash items will be delivered via crane to players who can then manipulate the speed and direction they fall using the DualShock 3 controller. The trash can will quickly reach full capacity unless the trash is broken down or dealt with by strategically using various elements given throughout each stage. Items will continue to be dropped until the player successfully compacts a certain number of items or ends up with an overflowing trash can. Each level will also feature a giant Boss item that players need to destroy in a certain amount of time to avoid getting penalized. At the end of each stage, each player will be rated by how eco-friendly or ego-friendly each stage was completed. The more eco-friendly, the higher the rating. Ratings help in unlocking various levels and modes. Spread across three different game modes, Trash Panic offers fun gaming for everyone. The Main Mode will take players progressively through six stages that increase in difficulty the further you advance. Vs. Mode allows two players to battle one another on the same screen. And lastly, Mission Mode offers mini-games for those who want to further their fun with a variety of waste management missions. Trash Panic also offers ways for players to show off their skills with trophy support and online learderboards. Additionally, players will have a recording option to upload up to 10 minutes of a gaming session onto YouTube to share with the rest of the world!
