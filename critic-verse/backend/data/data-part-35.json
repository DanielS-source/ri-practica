Airbase Defender is an old-school action game with an 80s flair.  The objective of the game is to prevent enemy paratroopers from conquering your base and blowing up the player-controlled FLAK cannon.  Three types of weapons can be used for defence. The first is the FLAK cannon, which can shoot down falling paratroopers before they reach the ground. For shooting down five paratroopers, the player is rewarded with a smart missile which can shoot down helicopters.  A very special weapon is the so-called &#34;shake&#34;. As soon as the player has shot down five helicopters, shaking the iPhone releases an atomic shockwave that destroys all visible enemies at once. Only the few paratroopers that have taken shelter under the player&#39;s FLAK cannon are spared this gruesome fate. The &#34;shake&#34; is accompanied by a vibration signal from the iPhone.  The cannon is controlled either by accelerometer or using a slider (so-called Classic Mode). The missiles are fired by tapping the screen at their desired destination.  The game graphics are lovingly designed with great attention to detail in a 2D pixel style that is deliberately reminiscent of the arcade games of the 80s.  The action-packed gameplay is accompanied by Heavy-Metal music. The menu features an orchestral soundtrack, setting the mood before the player faces the challenge ahead.  Furthermore, the game supports Openfeint - a system which allows players to compare their high scores with each other worldwide.  For everyone who loves classic action games in the style of Sabotage, there is no alternative to Airbase Defender.

YES, PHYSICS *CAN* BE FUN!!! Use gravity to your advantage in this addicting physics-based action game!  ? The Goal Fill more than 66% of the screen with shapes to complete a level. The game ends when you run out of shapes. Sounds easy, right? Think again! There are enemy particles and other shapes to worry about!  ? Creating a Shape To create a shape, simply touch the screen. Keep pressing to make bigger shapes. The shape drops to the bottom of the screen when you release your touch.  ? Enemies Look out for enemies when creating a shape. If they hit a growing shape before you drop it, the shape will be lost and you have one less shape to complete the level.  ? Rotating the Screen The shapes always fall to the bottom of the screen. You can rotate the screen to any angle you want. This is a good strategy to keep the enemies out of your way!  ? Scoring You get points for every shape you drop. When you complete a level, you get bonus points based on how many shapes you have left, how fast you completed the level, and how much of the screen you filled.  ? Zones There are several Zones in the game. Each one has its own shape. To unlock a Zone, you have to complete at least 9 levels from the Zone before it. The last Zone has a surprise, so be careful!  ? Pausing the Play To pause the game, simply double-tap the screen.  ? Game Saving Your progress is automatically saved as you play. Whenever you start a new level, that information is remembered. So if your game gets interrupted, you can continue where you left off the next time you launch the game.  ? The Toy Box In this mode, you can create any shape you wish. Simply touch the icon in the panel and create a shape as normal. You can create up to 20 shapes. You can move shapes around, delete them, and even clear the screen to start over. There are no enemies to worry about in the Toy Box, so enjoy yourself!   ? FEATURES ? Real physics-based interaction; watch the different shapes hit and roll off each other based on real mass and gravity! ? Use the accelerometer to change gravity...you can use this to your advantage ? Unlimited levels...your only limitation is how well you do ? 10 different Zones to play...each one offers unique challenges ? Global online leaderboards...rank yourself amongst other players worldwide! 10 different leaderboards to rank your scores. (Global leaderboard functionality provided by the AGON Online.) ?
