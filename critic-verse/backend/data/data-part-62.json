Avoid asteroids or vaporize them for special power-ups!  This exciting shoot &#39;em-up was inspired by the best elements of 1980&#39;s arcade classics. The genre is propelled in the 21st century through clever use of the iPhone/iPod&#39;s accelerometer. Tilt your device left or right to steer the ship and use your thumbs to thrust and shoot.  Unlike other games where the player can be upside-down in the screen, this game&#39;s camera follows to the player&#39;s ship as it moves around in the universe. This perspective, borrowed from 3-D games, works especially well for this type of 2-D shooter on the iPhone (and iPod touch) and allows the player to immerse more easily in the gameplay rather than being distracted by an unintuitive metaphor. Think of it as 3rd person for a 2D scroller which has 360&ordm; of liberty of movement.  Be sure to upgrade your ship&#39;s shield and weapons systems with one of the many available power-ups before you reach the boss levels, or you won&#39;t measure up to the motherships. Don&#39;t forget to collect orange heart tokens: 25 and you get an extra life. If you&#39;re lucky, you might even find a red heart token, which gives you an extra life immediately.
