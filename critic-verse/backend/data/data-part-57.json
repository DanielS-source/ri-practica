It is also a brand new, huge and funny adventure game with gorgeous cartoon graphics. The humor reminds us the old classic adventures games.  The game is fully translated into several languages: English German Greek Italian French Spanish  The plot is crazy! You are Zeus the boss of Olympus which comes back to earth to save the planet. Everything is happening at the classical ancient Greek period (1000-300bc) but you have the chance of switching ages though a time machine.  Visit many Aegean islands including: Santorini, Delos, Mykonos, Milos, Karpathos and Crete. Solve many riddles, play some mini games, interact with ancient Greek mythology characters with hilarious dialogs and at the end&Ouml; try to save the planet!  FEATURES: * Play over 50 different places on the Greek islands. * Interact with many funny characters from the Greek Mythology. * Play many mini games. * Day &amp; night conditions and hidden extras. * Translated into 6 languages. * Brilliant high cartoon graphics.  INTERFACE: The point and click interface is as easy as that: You point and click somewhere on the game and you have two options: &#39;Examine&#39; (Click the eye) or &#39;Operate&#39; (Click the hand). &#39;Examine&#39; looks at the spot you clicked and &#39;Operate&#39; tries to do something with this spot.  Sometimes there are multiple choices that you can do or say. E.g.: &#39;Take the bottle&#39; and &#39;Leave the bottle there&#39;.In this case you will see this choice box before the text.Just click the choice you wish once to select it and oncemore to activate it. Its as simple as that!  The game is really open. You can go almost wherever youwant. If you want to get out of a place and visit another one just click on this icon. It means that there is an exit.  The character icon shows where you are standing on the place. You can climb ladders, sit on chairs etc. You can &#39;UseItems from the inventory&#39; to that icon as if you want to&#39;Operate&#39; something on you. E.g.: If you have a trousers inthe inventory and you want to wear it. You must click thetrousers and then this icon.  The &#39;face&#39; shows your mood. If Zeus gets angry with you, he quits the game!  The &#39;P&#39; shows your current points. &#39;the boat&#39; goes to the games menus. &#39;Back arrow&#39; saves and goes to main screen. &#39;X&#39; button saves and exits the game. The &#39;harp&#39; button mutes the sound and music.  The eight blank spots are your inventory. (Your pockets). Every item you take its stored there. It you take more than eight items then the &#39;down and up arrows&#39; are activated and you can scroll to view all your items. To &#39;USE&#39; and item just click it once (gets a red border) and then click the place you want to use it. After you click it once and if you want to cancel that action, just click the &#39;Eye and Hand button&#39; and you get the normal point and click interface again. You can click an item in the inventory and then click a second item in the inventory if you want to combine two items together.\", \"genre\": [\"Point-and-Click\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-02-20\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-112285-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-112285-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"CrazySoft (Developer)\", \"CrazySoft (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Happy Bakery\", \"title_search\": \"happy bakery\", \"title_keyword\": \"happy bakery\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/happy-bakery/\", \"summary\": \"Join Rue at Happy Bakery and bake 40 types of delicious bread and cakes!

The sequel to Delta Force: Xtreme is supported by the NovaWorld Community, a multiplayer network that provides smoother, faster and seamless gameplay for up to 150 players per game. With 10 single-player missions and nine co-op missions within two campaigns, players immerse themselves into the Delta Force experience by battling enemies in Asia.  Now available for download from www.novalogic.com, Valve, Direct2Drive and RealNetworks and at retail locations nationwide, DFX2 carries the recession busting price of just $29.99 (MSRP). DFX2 offers intense military gameplay in stunning 1080p Full HD and Dolby 7.1 Surround sound, and with game servers placed strategically around the world, the NovaWorld Community provides the gameplay that fans demand.  Featuring 20 content-rich multiplayer maps, DFX2 supports five of the most popular game types: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Team King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, and Flagball. Each detailed map has something for everyone, from large, vehicle heavy battlefields to small, intense engagement zones. In addition to the feature-loaded multiplayer experience, gamers of all skill levels can mix it up in two heart-pounding single-player or co-operative campaigns where  players assume the role of a Delta Force operator sent to Asia to bring a drug cartel and former Soviet mercenaries to justice. The NovaWorld Community allows every element of the gameplay, from the enhanced ballistics to the innovative in-vehicle spawn system, to be carefully coordinated to support a fully balanced experience where teamwork is deadlier than individual firepower, and in DFX2, intelligence and creativity are rewarded as much as fast-twitch reflexes. The game also ships with a powerful MED level editor, which will allow gamers full utilization of game assets to create their own levels, including additional multiplayer game types.
