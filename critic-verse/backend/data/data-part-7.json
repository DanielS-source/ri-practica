At last, an iPhone/iPod Touch game really devised with children in mind. &#34;My First Game&rdquo; is an early-learning game entirely devised for children aged 3 to 6, which they can play either on their own or along with their parents. &#34;My First Game&rdquo; offers a total of 12 different activities which are both fun and encourage learning. Many different skills are covered, such as recognising shapes, writing, memory, music etc. For example, children are presented with the following tasks: -Forming numbers and letters of the alphabet -Identifying animal sounds -Finding the odd one out in a list of objects -Putting together a puzzle -Memorising the position of cards -Playing a tune on the piano -And more Each activity has different variations in order to constantly reawaken the child&rsquo;s interest. The level of difficulty can be adapted to each age group. The world of play comes alive and in colour. There are lots of animations and sound effects to highlight the child&rsquo;s actions. Children are supported and guided all the time by Zaps, a sort of cartoon character. Zaps will take every opportunity to help children, congratulate them or show them where they have gone wrong, by speaking to them in person. Zaps explains the purpose of each activity and how it works using explicit, visual tutorials that can be accessed at any time during the game, which is perfect for children who are still unable to read. Children are rewarded for the progress they make during the game. Every time they successfully complete a series of activities, they can unlock a new picture to add to their collection. This offers them motivation and satisfaction. Three different game modes are available: -&ldquo;My notebook&rdquo; mode offers children a number of random activities. -&ldquo;My activities&rdquo; mode allows them to choose one of twelve available activities which they can do. -Finally, &ldquo;My presents&rdquo; mode gathers all the presents the children have won as they have progressed through the game. Are you looking for a program specifically designed for children where they can learn and have fun at the same time? Look no further.

For each connection, you want to connect as many lights as possible so that you can gain bonuses in your time and score.  Obstacles are introduced later in the game, so be prepared.   -----------------------   ******************************* Arcade Mode - Description ******************************* In Arcade, the blocks fall from above and must be rotated to the correct position before touching the bottom of the screen.  Obstacles will be introduced throughout the game, so be prepared.   -----------------------   ******************************* Strategy ******************************* Try playing from the right to the left, rather then the other way around.  Make as many connections to one path as you can to generate time and score bonuses.  This is very important, as the game will be impossible without this strategy after a few levels.  Each mode offers 40 levels of gameplay which get exponentially harder as you progress.  Good luck!    ******************************* What to Expect for the Future ******************************* With future updates, we will be giving our users access to new features such as: New Obstacles, New Game Modes, Network High Scores, and more!    As always, all updates will be provided free of charge for any/all buying customers -----------------------------------------------   ******************************* We Welcome Your Thoughts, Opinions, and Ideas! ******************************* We built Power Grid to be the most fun and addicting easy-to-play on any time schedule application possible (whew!).
