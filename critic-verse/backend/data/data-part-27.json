A fix is on the way and this should be resolved shortly. Thanks for your patience!  Drifting is the act of maneuvering a vehicle through corners at speeds and angles that exceed the vehicle&rsquo;s grip.  A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.   It&rsquo;s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It&rsquo;s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control.  Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package.  Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber.  It can&rsquo;t get any better! ____________________________________   HOW TO PLAY Drifting is a very unique Motorsport where points are allocated on 4 main criteria: Speed, Line, Angle and Impact.   LINE: Drift within pre-designated zones to get extra points. The line is marked by several clipping points or clipping zones where the driver must get as close as possible while sideways to increase score.  ANGLE: The more the better. Drift with style and try to get your car as sideways as possible without wiping out to gain more points.  SPEED: Always try to drift as fast as possible while staying in control. If you hit a wall or get off-track, you will lose your current combo score. If you complete the race quickly, you will gain additional points.  IMPACT: This is the show factor! It&rsquo;s about entertaining the crowd and delivering an exciting performance.  Make them cheer; everyone enjoys the smell of burning rubber. ____________________________________  NEXT GENERATION GAMEPLAY Stunning 3D graphics using the multi-touch capabilities of your device to simulate an authentic drifting experience.

Galaxy on Fire 2&trade; sets new standards and offers unprecedented quality and game depth for the sci-fi genre: discover a galaxy with more than 20 solar systems and 100 different 3D space stations. The epic story featurs full voice acting, dramatically portrays the battle for survival of the Terrans, Midorians, Nivellians and Vossks and provides over 10 hours of exciting space adventure. Together with a countless number of freelance missions, over 30 space ships that can be fully customized and a complex trading simulation, Galaxy on Fire 2&trade; is the ultimate sci-fi benchmark in the App Store.  The mercenary Keith T. Maxwell, the hero of the first part, is catapulted through space and time because of a malfunction in the hyperdrive of his space ship. He wakes up 35 years later and finds himself in a very different galaxy. The fragile peace between the four peoples, which has been maintained for generations by the galaxy&rsquo;s diplomats, is on the line: the Voids, an aggressive alien race, have entered the known universe using wormhole technology. United by a common enemy, the former adversaries now fight side by side for the survival of the galaxy.  Determine the fate of Keith T. Maxwell: follow the main plot, complete various missions as you go, or simply hunt and capture goods from your victims. Sell your loot for maximum profit on one of the many space stations so that you can keep your ship equipped with the best weapons and specialist gear. Land on asteroids and mine for ore which can be used in conjunction with blueprints to manufacture rare equipment or trading goods. Using new special weapons, tactical commands to your wingmen and the option of taking over control of the gun turrets of your ship, you must prove yourself in all kinds of situations, from special secret missions to epic space battles, in order to save the galaxy.

Each is guaranteed to have at least 1 solution.  How to play:  The player is given a set of square tiles (either 9, 16, 25, or 36 depending on the skill level selected), with a number on each edge of the tile.  The objective of the game is to place all tiles on the game board in the proper position as quickly as possible.  A tile may only be placed if the numbers on adjacent tile faces match.    Use the hint button to reveal a hint for the first unoccupied space on the game board but use hints sparingly as they add to your time!  Try to beat your best times and good luck!\", \"genre\": [\"Matching Puzzle\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-06-24\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-158172-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-158172-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"TKO Software (Publisher)\", \"TKO Software (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Red Bull Flugtag\", \"title_search\": \"red bull flugtag\", \"title_keyword\": \"red bull flugtag\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/red-bull-flugtag/\", \"summary\": \"Put on your flight goggles and participate in the world&#39;s funniest competition!

Wind harps are the oldest forms of automatic music. The app uses the wind harp as a metaphor to generate relaxing animations and sounds.  Touches and strokes generate visualizations and sounds which evolve in time.  User defined parameter and color schemes can be used to explore the manifoldness of the underlying particle system.  The compass can be used to locate sounds in the four directions of the winds.  The acceleration sensor is used to simulate the impact of gravity on the flowing particles. (You must increase the impact of gravity in the parameter settings to see the effects.)  Snapshots of the animation can be send via e-mail.
