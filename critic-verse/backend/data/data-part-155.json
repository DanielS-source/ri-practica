If you&rsquo;d like to appreciate this game as art, I would recommend that you play it first without reading on.  Discover the game for yourself:  How do you play? What is the goal? What does it mean to you?  HOW TO PLAY Tilt the device to move / adjust the arc of your DOTNUKE. You can also touch the screen to simulate a tilt.  The game is intended to be played from a comfortable sitting position, with the device held in front of the player at a casual 45&deg; angle, not flat on a table.  However, you can also touch the screen to move!  Touching outward from the center of the screen simulates a tilt to the left or right, or forward or back.  Touching farther from the center of the screen, you can simulate a stronger tilt.  Touch controls can be ideal if you&rsquo;re playing DOTNUKE while lying down.  Try mixing up these two control methods to form your own play style!  GOAL Most importantly, the goal is to relax and enjoy DOTNUKE.  But for fun, you can attempt these additional goals, or make up your own:  - How quickly can you &lsquo;detonate&rsquo;? - How long can you survive before &lsquo;detonation&rsquo;?   COLORS Your DOTNUKE has a randomly generated color.  All game objects, effects, and fades are tuned to be aesthetically pleasing, based on this color.   However, if you like, you can change your DOTNUKE&rsquo;s color by shaking your device.  This can be practical if your DOTNUKE&rsquo;s color happens to be very similar to the background color.  MEANING DOTNUKE is an art game, and its meaning is open to interpretation.  Something I felt when I played the game was how we all have the ability to make choices, but we must live with the consequences and permanence of the decisions we make.  You may find a different meaning in DOTNUKE!  FEEDBACK Let me know what you think of DOTNUKE! What do you see?  What does it mean to you?

In the Battleships by OrientMaple you can play with a smart computer. The ships belong to the 16th century.  Following is the basic instruction: Choose a never attacked enemy grid, and you can tap it to attack. If you need to enlarge the map, you can touch the screen with two fingers and pull it up and down, and if you want to lessen it, you just need to do oppositely.  Start a new game, and proceed to place your ships on the grid. Every player has five ships. You can choose automatic placement of the ships (Auto Deploy button), or place them manually on the board. Manual placement is done by choosing a ship and dragging it onto a legal position on the board. The players can not only drag the warship out of the board to change their direction, they can also directly double-tap to make it. Press START button when all ships are placed.  In volley shot, the player fires until they miss. In salvo shot, the player has one shot for every still afloat vessel. As the game begins, you can see your own fleet while the opponent&rsquo;s fleet remains unseen. When a ship is partially damaged, the grid will change the color on which the damaged section of the ship is located. If the ship is completely destroyed, a sinking ship is displayed.  Players take turns firing guns and trying to destroy the opponent&rsquo;s fleet. When a player hits the ship, he/she continues to fire until the first miss; the turn then goes to the opponent, and the game continues. The game continues until one fleet is completely destroyed. The player whose fleet is destroyed first loses the game.  &radic; FEATURES: WIFI Game Auto positioning Ideal battleship game Guessing game Puzzle game Logic Game Strategy Game Board Game Volley shot Salvo shot Awesome background music True-to-life experience Human-like artificial intelligence Fast-paced AI 3 Difficulty levels Realistic sound performance Play games on your device anytime Gorgeous graphics Friendly operator interface Cool gaming interface Full-featured help page  &radic; NOTE: Below there is a step by step tutorial guiding you how to use the customized background music function of Battleships: Start your iPod application (in your iPhone or iPod Touch); Choose your preferred song and play it; Click your Home Button; Start Battleships;  &radic; SUPPORT: If you have any further questions, comments or suggestions, please email to support@orientmaple.com\", \"genre\": [\"Board\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-02-10\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-144514-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-144514-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"orientmaple.com (Publisher)\", \"orientmaple.com (Developer)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Robot Rampage\", \"title_search\": \"robot rampage\", \"title_keyword\": \"robot rampage\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/robot-rampage/\", \"summary\": \"The invasion has arrived, and YOU are the invader.

It was first released on January 2nd, 2009, and since then has garnered favorable reviews and has spawned two full sequels. It also holds the very dubious honor of being the first ever survival horror game developed with RPG Maker VX. \\r \\r The Complex... At one point, it was obviously some sort of bustling, busy epicentre of human activity, the nerve center of all sorts of scientific endevours and the military stronghold of an entire armed force. This can be evidenced by the sheer complexity of the place...\\r Buildings sprawling over each other, subterranian levels, airfields, hangars, vast underground laboratories...\\r But then again, if it ever was those things, it surely isn't now. Something happened there long ago, and now The Complex is abandoned, crumbling, and eerily silent, it's inhabitants seemingly vanished into nothing in the blink of an eye.\\r It seems like The Complex is just... no longer there. It's never been heard from since that day when... whatever went wrong went wrong, and nobody who has set out looking for it has ever returned. No maps seem to mark it's location anymore, and not even GPS surveilance can sight anything in the endless expanse of forest it once called it's home.\\r Some have even gone so far as saying the place doesn't exist.\\r There's some sort of secret behind that place... And what happened there. The Complex holds many such surprises, and a treasure trove of mysteries too. But it also holds a strangling atmosphere of terror, and a horrific fate which has changed it into a world of dread and danger.\\r \\r You have just opened your eyes from a long period of unconsciousness, finding yourself sprawled on the cracked stone floor of one of The Complex's many abandoned rooms. Remembering only your name, you must now set out into the darkness that has infested this place, and discover who you are, why you are there, and what terrible catastrophy turned the once bustling Complex into what you are about to experience.\\r \\r Game Features\\r \\r - Scary atmosphere and locations, with eerie audio and dark lighting effects to set a frightening mood.\\r - Relentless enemies which will hunt you endlessly, and which you cannot defeat!\\r - Mysterious story filled with puzzles and secrets to discover.\", \"genre\": [\"Survival\"], \"metascore\": 0, \"critic_reviews\": 0, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2009-01-02\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-191539-52.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-191539-52.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": null, \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"Dark Gaia Studios (Developer)\", \"Dark Gaia Studios (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"PC\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Ziggurat (2012)\", \"title_search\": \"ziggurat 2012\", \"title_keyword\": \"ziggurat 2012\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/ziggurat-2012/\", \"summary\": \"ZiGGURAT is the end of a much longer story -- a story which ends with The Last Human On Earth standing atop a stratosphere-high stone pyramid, wielding a laser rifle against an endless wave of relentless alien freaks.\\r \\r Where did the alien freaks come from?
