The pick-up-and-play gameplay makes ingenious use of the Nintendo DS stylus to draw platforms to climb and hop across, dodging difficult barriers and any cold-hearted misanthropes who get in the way. Along the way our protagonists will draw, climb and jump their way through the city, zoo, carnival, park and beach, with each vibrant area packed with opportunities to impress your sweatheart by bowling over bad guys and collecting fruit and stars. Felix and Felicity will have no shortage of help in their date-race against the clock with sage love advice from worldly-wise characters you meet along the way and in-game power-ups including Time-Freeze, Love-Rush, Newton-Bomb and the explosive Love-Nuke.
