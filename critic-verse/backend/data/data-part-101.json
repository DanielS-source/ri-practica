Working on update for OS 3.0 and will soon to release the new version.  Most brain-teasing games are designed with a certain level of difficulty &ndash; either it is too easy for adults, like the 10-piece jigsaw puzzles, or too difficult, like the Rubiks Cube that very few can solve.  Most players either lose interest because it is too easy or feel frustrated because it is too difficult to solve.    Are you looking for a puzzle game that anyone can play, but still offers plenty to master? Look no further than LONPOS, it is a fantastic award winning game that has received a huge amount of attention around the world.  LONPOS is the result of many years of research and development to create a fun, enjoyable and challenging brain exercise game for all ages.    Beware, LONPOS is a very addictive game, so it&rsquo;s the perfect game to return to again and again.  Play it against yourself or have great fun when two or more players compete with each other to see who can finish a game first.   LONPOS is an innovative game that enhances hand-eye coordination, improves cognitive logic skills, and trains short-term memory.  Playing the LONPOS is like doing a Yoga exercise with your brain.  It tickles your brain with an easy level puzzle that you can solve in a minute.  But don&rsquo;t be fooled &ndash; it is just a warm up exercise to prepare you for more challenging puzzles ahead.  When you play the more challenging level puzzles, it will give your brain a good stretch for hours, even days.  But when you complete the puzzle, you will feel like a genius with a fantastic sense of achievement and you&#39;re ready to move onto the next puzzle.   LONPOS consists of 12 building blocks (known as Pentominoes), each unique in shape and color.  Each Pentomino can be rotated in 90&deg; intervals or can be flipped in 180&deg; to create a mirror image. Each puzzle revolves around a rectangular game board of 55 spaces. The goal is to place all Pentominoes into the game board to occupy all 55 spaces.  That sounds easy doesn&rsquo;t it?  Don&rsquo;t be fooled!  Not every puzzle you set out will have a unique answer and each new puzzle will be a new challenges.  Challenge yourself or others to see who can complete the most puzzle and within the shortest time.    LONPOS comes with 303 preset puzzles to solve and you can also set your own additional ones.  There are over 360,000 puzzles to play for years of fun.  Some take you minute to solve.

Some say it started with the launch of Solitaire on Windows 95.  However, in the past 10 years, with the successes of digitally distributed casual games, there have been three major occurrences that changed the industry.  The first wave started with Bejeweled and Zuma.  As a result nearly every game launched was a match 3 game for several years.  A few years later Betty&rsquo;s Beer Bar launched, followed by Diner Dash.  These time management games started a new craze in casual games.  In November of 2005, Big Fish Games developed and released Mystery Case Files: Huntsville, and the market experienced its most recent shift.  The success of the Mystery Case Files series inspired Hidden Expedition, Hidden Mysteries, and many other great hidden-object games.

The lightest ones can be played casually while waiting for the bus. The middling ones take from 5 to 20 minutes of concentrated thought. The heaviest levels demand intense, rigorous, error-free reasoning for half an hour or more.

The opponent has to beat the call of the first player. A &laquo;chigg&raquo;&nbsp;(3 x 1) beats everything. The opponent wins also, if she/he dices the same number with less dice.  After the program start you&#39;ll see two entry fields:  Player 1 / Player 2 -&gt; enter the names of the players here. If you want to play against the iPhone, leave &laquo;iPhone&raquo;&nbsp;in the field for player 2. When you entered the names, click on &laquo;Start&raquo;.  For Multiplayer Mode click on &laquo;Network Game&raquo; - you don&#39;t have to enter any names then.  Choose the iPhone/iPod you want to play with from the upcoming list. The other player will receive a request that she/he has to accept.  You dice by clicking on the 3 dice on the lower right corner of the screen, or by shaking the iPhone (WARNING: SHAKE FIRMLY(!) AND HOLD THE IPHONE/IPOD TIGHT SO YOU DON&#39;T THROW IT AWAY! I DO NOT TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY DAMAGE!)  The game starts  Every player gets one dice to determine which player begins. The player with the highest number begins. If both players dice the same number, this step will be repeated.  The player who calls will see a bar that indicates the number she/he diced and a greater-than/lesser-then (&lt; &gt;) sign. By clicking on these, you determine whether the opponent has to score more or less than the player who calls (e.g. 12 &gt; means that the opponent has to dice more than 12). If you dice a 1 or a 6 you can turn these numbers into 100 or 60 respectively. If you dice 2 x 6, you can choose whether you want to turn one of the sixes into a 1 (remember 3 x 1 beats all!). And, you can &laquo;save&raquo; a die by tapping on it. Then, a green hook appears which indicates that this die won&#39;t be used for the next dice. This way, you can work towards a &laquo;chigg&raquo; (or any other number) you wish to score (e.g. in the first dice, you have two ones, then you&#39;re gonna &laquo;save&raquo;&nbsp;those ones and try to dice another one with just the third die). To make things even more complicated: when you dice two sixes and turn them into 60s, the opponent can&#39;t beat this by turning a one into 100 (unless the player who calls had a one turned into 100 as well - e.g. the caller has 6 - 6 - 3 -&gt; 60 + 60 + 3 = 123. The opponent has 6 - 1 - 5 -&gt; 60 + 1 + 5 = 66. That&#39;s where strategy comes in :) When the calling player reached the number she/he wishes the opponent to beat, she/he taps on the &laquo;&lt; &gt;&raquo; sign to determine whether the opponent has to dice a higher or lower number.  When it&#39;s the opponent&#39;s turn, the &laquo;&lt; &gt;&raquo; signs won&#39;t show up as she/he just has to beat what the calling player offered. The opponent wins when: she/he has the same number in less throws or a higher/lower number with the same amount of throws. Again: 3 x 1 (&laquo;chigg&raquo;) beats all.  The player who loses will receive a &laquo;coin&raquo;. The player who collects 3 coins first, loses. If - for example - player a has 2 coins and player b 1 coin and player b loses, she/he will receive a coin from player a.  Game indicator:  On the upper right of the screen are two bars: Player 1/ Player 2 where the names of the players are shown, as well as the amount of throws and the call from the calling player. There&#39;s another indicator showing how many games a player won so far.  Autoplay:  When you play against &laquo;iPhone&raquo;, the phone dices itself. You&#39;ll see the call (or the number diced) in the bar on the upper right of the screen...

Art Thief is a game for the iPhone and iPod Touch about the legendary artwork thief John Robie. Robie travels from one city to the next on his quest to steal all the major artwork in the world.   Each level is a museum dedicated to a single major artist. Robie enters after closing and has to find the artist&#39;s five major masterpieces before the museum opens again.
