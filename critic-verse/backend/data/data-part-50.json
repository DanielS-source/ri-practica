Similar to Text Twist, Word Warp is a challenging anagram type of word game in which you try to form as many words as you can out of the six letters you are given before time runs out. &nbsp;You will receive points for each correct word you come up with, but in order to advance to the next level you must come up with at least one word that uses all six letters.  Stumped? &nbsp;Word Warp has a Warp Button that will rearrange the letters for you so you may recognize some words you previously missed. &nbsp;There is also an option to change the allotted game time to give yourself more time - or make it more challenging.  Once the level is completed, you are given the list of all the possible words and you can tap any of the words to see its definition.  So if you want a fun and addicting game that keeps your brain sharp and builds your vocabulary at the same time, then definitely give Word Warp a try!  Free Word Warp is a fully-featured, but ad-supported version of Word Warp.  If you like Free Word Warp, but prefer it without ads, you can purchase Word Warp without ads from the App Store.

The goal of your quest has a spiritual dimension -- to transcend the succession of dungeon worlds and escape the endless cycle of births and deaths. But the way is not easy. You must discover your destiny and find a path to it. You must master the virtues of a true cosmic traveller and pass the tests that qualify you to complete your ultimate fate.   THE SECRET OF MACROCOM GAMES What makes Macrocom simulations unique? To start with, they are 100% graphic. You are in action, not reading about action. Macrocom simulations involve you more in the story than other computer games for the IBM PC do. Our programs don't come between you and the story.   SUPERIOR GRAPHICS  The secret is our special graphic process. We are not limited to the single display page and four color business graphics palette of the IBM. Dozens of beings can be on the screen at the same time -- each moving and behaving independently.  And seeing is believing... Macrocom games give you more colors andmore resolution than you have ever seen on a standard IBM -- sixteen colors at 320 x 200 dot resolution.   EXCLUSIVELY FOR IBM PCs AND IBM COMPATIBLES Macrocom can make your IBM PC do more because our programs aren't designed for Ataris or Commodores but for you and your IBM. Macrocom takes advantage of the greater memory of your IBM PC and of its special, undocumented graphic capabilities.   ALL THE WORLD IS A STAGE And you are a player on it. There's more to Macrocom simulations -- epic scope and plots, mythic situations, and remarkably realistic environments. Computer adventure plots don't have to resemble computer programs. Quit fighting with programs that make you think like a programmer.
