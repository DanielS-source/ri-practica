After the destruction of the Altar, a powerful magical surge sent a shockwave of unrelenting energy throughout the Empire of the Eight Demons, covering it wholly in a thick layer of ice and plunging it into a time of utter darkness. The world ended. To this day scholars still argue about the exact time but at least five centuries later the surviving humans and daevi awoke to find themselves in an existence that had changed forever. Their once bright heavens and beautiful skies had turned into a thick layer of rock. Outside of it a swirling maelstrom of burning magical energy engulfed all the remnants of a storm of dead spells. Set within a dark post-apocalyptic fantasy world, you will assume the role of a hero bound to find the secrets that lie hidden in the past, present and future. Within hollow rock-realms known as Shards, floating in the confines of the magical Deadspell Storm, a civilization consisting of humans and daevi struggles to rediscover the pieces of their shattered world. This civilization is known as the Enclave of the Five Sacrifices. Although most of the Shards are known to the Enclave, myths and legends tell of many strange and wonderful Shards but these are almost certainly derived from the stories of those that struggled to survive the aftermath of the destruction of the Ancestor World.
