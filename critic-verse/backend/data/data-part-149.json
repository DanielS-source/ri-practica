JU-ON: The Grudge for Wii is a Haunted House Simulator where accessibility and instant scares are given priority over all other game aspects, with the original creator of the movie, Takashi Shimizu, serving as a creative consultant to game development. It is said that when a person dies with a deep and burning grudge, a curse is born. When an average housewife in Nerima, Japan, was murdered in a grisly fashion, it gave rise to a curse so powerful that it threatens to kill at a pace thought unimaginable before. The curse manifests on those who encounter the curse by any means, such as entering the house or being in contact with somebody who was already cursed. Once Erika Yamada is exposed to the curse while searching for her dog in an abandoned warehouse, the entire Yamada family is put in grave danger as soon as she reunites with them at home. They must now face their individual challenges alone, and only by overcoming the curse together will their family truly be free again. Using the Wii Remote as a flashlight, JU-ON: The Grudge has players move forward with the touch of a button and explore haunted areas such as an abandoned warehouse, a dimly-lit hospital, and a mannequin factory. Much like a haunted house, the player must proceed forward even after being frightened and running away from the initial threat. As much fun as it is to get scared, sometimes it\\u2019s even more fun to watch others play to observe their reactions. For instant gratification, grab a second Wii Remote and push buttons to make in-game events happen immediately to make the player jump and hate you forever.

Don&#39;t just take our word for it here is what the Critics think:  &#34;Gravity Runner&rsquo;s retro graphics combined with the smooth gameplay, and the gravity-switching novelty, makes it extremely entertaining to play. The app&rsquo;s developer (We Are Colin) has done a great job.&#34; - App Advice  &#34;We have been lucky enough to be among the few who got to review it early and I&rsquo;ve had a hard time putting it down.&#34; - The Portable Gamer  &#34;Gravity Runner has stepped up the bar for past and future platformers and it is a game that anyone, from any age and era, can definitely enjoy.&#34; - Touch Gen - 4/5  &#34;Gravity Runner takes retro runners to a whole new frustratingly addictive level&#34; - Touch Aholics  &#34;This game is a perfect example of how you can turn a good game (like Canabalt) and make it super awesome!&#34; - ExtraLives.tv  At such a small price, why wouldn&#39;t you try it out!?  ------------- GRAVITY RUNNER -------------  Take control of Colin as he automatically runs through levels filled with pitfalls and spikes. Tap the screen to make Colin jump over obstacles in his world.  But this alone won&rsquo;t keep him alive.   If you tap the screen while Colin is in mid-air, gravity will be flipped! Master this gravity flipping ability to help Colin jump, glide and evade all obstacles placed in his path.   Gravity Runner not only plays fantastic, but looks and sounds great too. The game has retro graphics, and charming sound to give a new twist to the classic platform game. You&#39;d be crazy to miss out on Gravity Runner, especially for such a small price!  Gravity Runner is nauseatingly addictive and will always leave you wanting just one more go!\", \"genre\": [\"Action\"], \"metascore\": \"66\", \"critic_reviews\": 6, \"user_score\": 0, \"user_reviews\": 0, \"release_date\": \"2010-08-12\", \"images\": [\"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-162439-17.jpg\", \"https://www.metacritic.com/a/img/catalog/provider/6/12/6-1-162439-17.jpg\"], \"video\": null, \"video_thumbnail\": null, \"video_type\": null, \"sentiment\": \"Mixed or average\", \"must_play\": false, \"crew\": null, \"countries\": [\"North America\"], \"companies\": [\"We Are Colin (Developer)\", \"We Are Colin (Publisher)\"], \"platforms\": [\"iOS (iPhone/iPad)\"], \"rating\": null}", "{\"title\": \"Mission DLC Pack for Valkyria Chronicles II\", \"title_search\": \"mission dlc pack for valkyria chronicles ii\", \"title_keyword\": \"mission dlc pack for valkyria chronicles ii\", \"url\": \"https://www.metacritic.com/game/mission-dlc-pack-for-valkyria-chronicles-ii/\", \"summary\": \"Download this 22 mission pack that will take Avan and his friends through more adventures in Europa!
