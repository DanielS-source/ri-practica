Players use iOS devices to cast spells to attack and defend.This game can be played with 2-4 players.  Invite up to 3 friends to join a game.

Each player is given a &ldquo;target&rdquo; which will appear as a red dot on the radar screen.  The other players (non-targets) will appear as green dots on the radar screen.  Each player is always at the center of their radar screen and will not appear as a dot.  The objective is for a player to get near enough to their target to cast a spell.  Once a spell is cast, the target will be alerted that they have been attacked, and will be prompted to cast a defensive spell.  Experience points are awarded for a successful attack as well as for a successful defense (more points are awarded for a successful attack than for a successful defense).  Success in attack or defense is determined by an RPG style calculation involving several upgradable properties.  As players gain experience points, they will be able to upgrade the strength of their spells, and increase their chances of casting successful spells (attack and defense).  Once a player has attacked their target, they will be given a new target (if there are more than two players in the game), and they will need to get close to them to cast another spell.  While a player is tracking down their target, they may also be hunted down by other players.
